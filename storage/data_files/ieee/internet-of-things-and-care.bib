 title={Automatic Ocular Disease Screening and Monitoring Using a Hybrid Cloud System}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={263-268},   abstract={The maturity of healthcare IoT technology which connects medical devices and applications to healthcare IT systems through internet has driven the rapid growth of healthcare. In recent years, great effort has been spent to improve ocular disease screening and diagnosis using advanced image and data analysis techniques. However, the developed systems are not widely used because they are usually offline and separated from medical devices. In this paper, we introduce a platform that connects medical devices, patients, ophthalmologists, and intelligent ocular disease analysis systems through a cloud-based system. The platform is designed in a hybrid cloud pattern to offer both easy accessibility and enhanced security. The retinal fundus images and patients' personal data can be uploaded to the public cloud tier through multiple channels including retinal fundus cameras, web portals, mobile applications and APIs. The data will be transferred to the private cloud tier where automatic analysis and assessment will be performed using advanced pattern classification algorithms. Subsequently, the analysis report will be made available in the public tier so that patients can access their own report through mobile applications or web portals. Furthermore, patients with high risk of having ocular diseases will be referred to ophthalmologists. The platform helps to form an integrated ecosystem that enables an efficient and cost-effective way of ocular disease screening and monitoring, allowing early disease detection and intervention.},   keywords={cloud computing;diseases;health care;image classification;Internet of Things;medical image processing;hybrid cloud system;healthcare IT systems;advanced image and data analysis techniques;medical devices;cloud-based system;advanced pattern classification algorithms;ophthalmologists;disease detection;ocular disease screening;Diseases;Cloud computing;Retina;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical imaging;Internet of Things;healthcare;ocular diseases;disease screening;computer aided diagnosis;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.68},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={The constant rapid growth and development of modern medical technology has resulted in an ever-growing demand for higher quality health monitoring systems. This is especially true for the development of the Internet of Things: as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous in dally life, so does the possibility of, and demand for, the ability to remotely monitor the health of patients at anytime, anywhere, using a wide variety of biometrie information. Thus e-Healthcare has become a significant trend in the medical field. In addition to monitoring a patient's health remotely, data can also be relayed to doctors or hospitals in real-time, in order to assist in correct medical decision-making. Hospitals have begun to implement this technology, and patients therefore have immediate access to required diagnoses and care. However, the use of a large number of remote medical sensors requires significant bandwidth, especially when relaying real-time information. Hospital networks thus become susceptible to problems arising from network congestion. This study proposes a load-balancing mechanism based on SDN-SFC for the optimization of hospital remote-monitoring network planning, which simultaneously eliminates the need for large amounts of hardware.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient monitoring;software defined networking;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication traffic;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;health monitoring systems;Internet of Things;e-healthcare sensor network load-balancing scheme;hospital remote-monitoring network planning;SDN-SFC;load-balancing mechanism;network congestion;hospital networks;relaying real-time information;remote medical sensors;Conferences;IEC;IEC Standards;Noise measurement;Cloud e-Healthcare;Wireless Body Area Network;Software-Defined Networking},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2017.8210833},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={60},   number={1},   pages={50-58},   abstract={This paper explores the use of a constructivist 21st-century learning model to implement a week-long workshop, delivered as a “hackathon,” to encourage preuniversity teenagers to pursue careers in STEM, with a particular emphasis on computer science. For Irish preuniversity students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students participated in the workshop and completed pre- and post-surveys, and a free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in computing. Analysis revealed that students' motivation to learn about the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in the computing word associations, with students associating computing more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as the Internet. The findings suggest that the combination of a hackathon event and a model for 21st century learning can be effective in motivating and increasing the self-efficacy of preuniversity teenagers in a number of emerging technological contexts such as IoT and wearables.},   keywords={computer aided instruction;computer science;educational institutions;human factors;Internet of Things;student experiments;wearable computers;IoT;wearable technology hackathon;computer science;constructivist 21st-century learning model;STEM;Irish preuniversity students;word processing;foundational programming;ICT;students motivation;Internet of Things;Computer science education;Internet of Things;Prototypes;Teamwork;Wearable computers;Computer science education;creativity;design thinking;Internet of Things (IoT);problem solving;prototypes;teamwork;wearable technologies},   doi={10.1109/TE.2016.2626252},   ISSN={0018-9359},   month={Feb},}

 title={An Integrated Platform for Dynamic Adaptation of Multi-tenant Single Instance SaaS Applications}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={257-264},   abstract={Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has recently been adopted by many organizations to get their work done through subscription-based services. To leverage economies of scale, software and hardware resources are shared among multiple tenants who have different requirements that rapidly change with time. Responding to tenants' diverse needs requires SaaS providers to carefully manage software variability so that every tenant feels like having a distinct instance of the application. Tenants' evolvable needs require the SaaS instance to dynamically adapt. This paper presents an integrated platform that facilitates the dynamic adaptation of Multi-Tenant Single Instance SaaS applications and supports runtime tenants' configurations customization. The proposed platform is based on three concepts: Service-Orientation, Software Product Lines (SPLs), and Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The proposed solution spans over two dimensions: Feature-level variability management and runtime variability management. We propose raising the level of abstraction in which the whole adaptation process is addressed to better manage customization. The feasibility of the approach is illustrated via a functioning prototype. A realistic SaaS application was used to exercise the different adaptation scenarios and evaluate the platform prototype implementation.},   keywords={cloud computing;service-oriented architecture;software product lines;Web services;integrated platform;dynamic adaptation;multitenant single instance SaaS applications;Software-as-a-Service;subscription-based services;multiple tenants;SaaS providers;SaaS instance;Software Product Lines;runtime variability management;realistic SaaS application;software variability management;application distinct instance;SPL;Model Driven Architecture;MDA;feature-level variability management;Software as a service;Databases;Runtime;Adaptation models;Cloud computing;Quality of service;Cloud;SaaS;Multi-tenant Applications;Dynamic Adaptation;SPL},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2017.39},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Although external fixation is being widely used by orthopedic surgeons in the treatment of bone fractures, the surgical procedure and recovery are still followed by a number of possible complications which can significantly decrease the treatment&amp;#x2019;s efficiency (cost) and effectiveness (optimal healing). Inability of the physician to have continuous insight into different data, fracture healing process, patient&amp;#x2019;s behavior and environmental factors could be considered as a reason for these complications. In this paper, we propose the improvement of a fixation device design, which implements paradigms of aware, sensing, smart and active devices and thus, enables real-time monitoring of bone fracture healing. Such a design is considered as IoT gateway, capable to classify occurrences of events and milestones in patient recovery process, based on the data from different sensors, and report those to the specialists or related Healthcare Information System. The design is implemented in the example of classifying patient&amp;#x2019;s compliance to the prescribed behavior in the postoperative treatment of bone fractures.},   keywords={Internet of Things;Medical treatment;Data analysis.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2819623},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

 title={Leveraging Unlabeled Data for Emotion Recognition With Enhanced Collaborative Semi-Supervised Learning}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={22196-22209},   abstract={One of the major obstacles that has to be faced when applying automatic emotion recognition to realistic human-machine interaction systems is the scarcity of labeled data for training a robust model. Motivated by this concern, this paper seeks to utmost exploit unlabeled data that are pervasively available in the real-world and easy to be collected, by means of novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches. Conventional SSL methods such as self-training, suffer from their inherent drawback of error accumulation, i.e., the samples that are misclassified by the system are continuously employed to train the model in the following learning iterations. To address this major issue, we first propose an enhanced learning strategy, by which we re-evaluate the previously automatically labeled samples in each learning iteration, in order to update the training set by correcting the mislabeled samples. We further exploit multiple modalities and models in the SSL system, by using collaborative SSL, where all modalities and models are considered simultaneously; samples are selected by means of minimizing the joint entropy. This strategy is supposed to not only improve the performance of the model for data annotation and consequently enhance the trustability of the automatically labeled data, but also to elevate the diversity of selected data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, we performed extensive experiments on the remote collaborative and affective database, which includes multimodal recordings of spontaneous affective interactions of dyads. The empirical results show that the proposed approaches significantly outperform recently well-established SSL methods.},   keywords={emotion recognition;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);realistic human-machine interaction systems;error accumulation;learning iteration;enhanced learning strategy;automatically labeled samples;mislabeled samples;multiple modalities;collaborative SSL;data annotation;automatically labeled data;selected data;remote collaborative;automatic emotion recognition;unlabeled data leveraging;enhanced collaborative semisupervised learning;Emotion recognition;Data models;Training;Predictive models;Semisupervised learning;Entropy;Collaboration;Enhanced semi-supervised learning;collaborative learning;audiovisual emotion recognition},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2821192},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In many of these applications, device size and battery life are of critical importance. Since radios often consume a significant portion of the power budget in small sensing nodes [1], reducing radio power consumption is an effective way to decrease battery size or increase battery life. Reducing radio power consumption can be challenging as there are important tradeoffs between power consumption and performance metrics such as radiated output power, linearity, sensitivity, channelization capabilities, and interference sensitivity. Low-power radio designs often sacrifice one or more of these metrics in the pursuit of low overall power consumption.},   keywords={radio transmitters;narrowband transmitters;ultralow power design;integrated radio design;wearable health care;Internet of Things devices;structural integrity monitors;power budget;Frequency shift keying;Power generation;Phase locked loops;Radio transmitters;Power demand;Narrowband;Low power electronics},   doi={10.1109/MMM.2015.2390111},   ISSN={1527-3342},   month={April},}

Our study shows that the edge layer DCs in a Mobile Edge Network (MEN) infrastructure is cost beneficial for the bandwidth-hungry applications having their strong demand locality and in the scenarios where large capacity is deployed at the edge layer DCs. The cost savings for such applications can go up to 67%. Additional intermediate layer DCs close to the root DC can be marginally cost beneficial for the compute intensive applications with medium or low demand locality. Hence, a Telecom Network Operator should start building an edge DC first having capacity up to hundreds of servers at the network edge to cater the emerging bandwidth-hungry applications and to minimize its operational cost.},   keywords={computer centres;mobile computing;operational cost minimization;telecom network operator;root DC;edge layer DC;IoT;Internet-of-things;health care;future bandwidth-hungry applications;congestion reduction;MEN infrastructure;mobile edge network infrastructure;intermediate layer data centers;Computational modeling;Bandwidth;Network topology;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Topology;Servers;Application Placement;Cost Optimization;Infrastructure Resource Placement;Mobile Edge Computing;Fog Computing},   doi={10.1109/FAS-W.2016.55},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

How could smart phones be used to make lives healthier? Smart phones could get to know when people were jogging, walking, travelling and standing on the basis of the GPS co-ordinates and the measured speed and could calculate the time spent relaxing with the help of a gyroscope. Portable sensors that are able to communicate wireless could provide further data about the momentary state of health and the need for fluid and calories. A smart phone could recognize the sudden change of the bodily position and could decide on the level of the seriousness of the situation by evaluating the values measured by the sensors. It is also worth sending a message to the ambulance if the fall is the consequence of losing consciousness, the measured data, the patient's condition and GPS positions can be life-saving information. In case of the indisposition of a driver, a smart phone could send instructions to the vehicle to take over the control from him and not to allow him to use the steering wheel or the pedals, the vehicle itself is to use them properly. It is to switch on the hazard warning flasher and the phone will drive the vehicle off the road to its edge while gradually decreasing the speed and paying attention to the position and the movements of the surrounding vehicles, objects, people and other living creatures. In the meantime the phone could also call the ambulance and send information about the precise location and the measured data. It might happen that the heart of a patient stops beating while driving or in other circumstances or that it beats so fast that it can not pump the blood. In such cases a smart phone could realize the problem with the help of a pulse counter (sphygmograph) and could make an attempt to resuscitate the patient with the defibrillator attached to it.},   keywords={alarm systems;biomedical communication;Global Positioning System;gyroscopes;health care;patient monitoring;radiocommunication;sensors;smart phones;smartphones;healthcare;jogging;walking;travelling;standing;GPS coordinates;gyroscope;portable sensors;wireless communication;momentary state of health;fluid;calories;bodily position;ambulance;patient condition;GPS positions;life-saving information;driver indisposition;steering wheel;pedals;hazard warning flasher;measured data;pulse counter;sphygmograph;defibrillator;Smart phones;Sensors;Global Positioning System;Diseases;Vehicles;Fluids;Home appliances;smartphone;healthcare;save live},   doi={10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.90},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

However, there are two main challenges faced by the IoT-enabled medical devices: energy-efficiency and security/privacy concerns. Researchers have independently attempted to develop solutions, such as low-power ECG-processors and security protocols, that address these challenges on an individual basis. However, it is imperative to investigate holistic solutions that integrate in a synergistic manner, delivering an overall secure and energy-efficient product. In this paper, we develop an ultra-low power and secure IoT sensing/pre-processing platform for prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using ECG signals. Our proposed solution is able to predict the on-set of the critical cardiovascular events upto 3 h in advance with 86% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is designed using an Application Specific Integrated Circuits design flow in 65-nm Low Power Enhanced technology; the power it consumes is 62.2% less than that of the state-of-the-art approaches, while occupying 16.0% smaller area. The proposed processor makes use of ECG signals to extract a chip-specific ECG key that enables protection of communication channel. By integrating the ECG key with an existing design-for-trust solution, the proposed platform offers protection also at the hardware level, thwarting hardware security threats, such as reverse engineering and counterfeiting. Through efficient sharing of on-chip resources, the overhead of the multi-layered security infrastructure is kept at 9.5% for area and 0.7% for power with no impact on the speed of the design.},   keywords={application specific integrated circuits;cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;power aware computing;power consumption;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;cardiovascular diseases;Internet-of-Things;health-care sector;noninvasive patient monitoring;IoT-enabled medical devices;low-power ECG-processors;ultralow power;secure IoT sensing-preprocessing platform;ventricular arrhythmia;ECG signals;application specific integrated circuits;low power enhanced technology;chip-specific ECG;communication channel;thwarting hardware security;on-chip resources;multilayered security infrastructure;design-for-trust solution;Electrocardiography;Security;Hardware;Reverse engineering;System-on-chip;Integrated circuit modeling;ECG;biomedical classifier;ventricular arrythmia;Internet of Things;hardware security;design-for-trust},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2017.2694968},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={Sept},}

It is estimated that there will be 50 billion small-scale IoT devices by 2020. These devices, however, are extremely vulnerable to side-channel attacks, therefore low-cost, low-power defense methods are highly desirable. This paper presents an effective method for secure state encoding of finite-state machine (FSM) based controllers to defend against power analysis attacks. Given a user-defined graded security metric, we derive constrained state encoding for the FSM controllers to mitigate information leakage through the power side-channel, resulting in low-power designs. Experimental results using over 100 FSMs from BenGen and MCNC benchmark suites show a graded increase in encoding length (40-70% for restructured FSMs) depending on the level of security chosen.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={335-341},   abstract={Individual surgeons rely on residency programs as their main conduit for developing the necessary soft skills needed to succeed and excel in the operating room. One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1]. We intend to coordinate with research scientists to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions incorporating existing data for training and real-time feedback.

Information technology has been helping in tracing criminals and terrorists, but with the outspread of social networks and the emergence of the Internet of Things, new challenges have arisen. The Internet is becoming a major part of everyone's daily life. Data representing trustful and suspicious activities is continuously generated and stored everywhere at an unprecedented scale. This extremely large data, which is known as Big Data, may contain critical and helpful information that can be used in detecting, and in many cases, preventing illegal activities, crimes and more importantly terror attacks. Unfortunately, the limitations on the communication between administrative zones, the huge amount of data and the intrinsically unstructured nature of such data makes leveraging its usefulness impractical. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cooperative analytics architecture that utilizes Big Data Analytics, Ontologies, and Metamodels to facilitate the analysis of data collected from different sources to aid law enforcement agencies' efforts in establishing law and maintaining security.},   keywords={Big Data;criminal law;data analysis;data mining;Internet;Internet of Things;national security;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data;social networking (online);terrorism;information technology;social networks;trustful activities;suspicious activities;illegal activities;crimes;hierarchical cooperative analytics architecture;Big Data Analytics;law enforcement agencies;crime investigation;safety;national security;security;terror attacks;Big Data;Data mining;Real-time systems;Organizations;Intelligent agents;Databases;Law enforcement;Big Data;Intelligent Agents;Ontologies;Metamodels;Data Mining},   doi={10.1109/IISA.2017.8316400},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Recently, there is a rapid increase in the deployment of Internet of Thing (IoT) networks in many areas such as smart building, industrial plants and agriculture fields. However, this type of network need to be carefully operated because there are many constraints that can impede the performance of the network such as the unreliable wireless channel conditions, and the limited processing capability of sensor motes. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which is designed for IoT devices but some mechanisms defined in the RPL standard document (RFC 6550) are underspecified. This issue can lead to interoperability problem between multiple hardware platforms. In this paper, we focus on one of the underspecified mechanisms in RPL, Neighbor Unreachable Detection (NUD) mechanism. Two approaches for improving NUD mechanism are proposed and implement in Zolertia Z1 motes: NUD with hello packets and NUD with DIO messages. The results from the experiments that vary the interference levels and consider node moving scenario show that both of the proposed NUD mechanisms can provide much better performance in term of Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) than the original NUD implementation in ContikiOS. The NUD implementation with DIO messages cannot match the similar level of performance of the NUD implementation with hello packets but it can be implemented without adding more complexity to the RPL protocol.},   keywords={Internet of Things;routing protocols;neighbor unreachability detection mechanism;RPL protocol;Internet of Thing;Internet engineering task force;IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks;IoT devices;NUD mechanism;Zolertia Z1 motes;packets;DIO messages;packet reception ratio;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Hardware;Network topology;Probes},   doi={10.1109/ICITEED.2016.7863233},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

The advancement of modern technologies, such as wireless communication, data processing, the Internet of Things, cloud, and edge computing, makes mobile healthcare simpler than before. In addition, the deep learning approach brings a revolution in the machine learning domain. In this paper, we investigate a voice pathology detection system using deep learning on the mobile healthcare framework. A mobile multimedia healthcare framework is also designed. In the voice pathology detection system, voices are captured using smart mobile devices. Voice signals are processed before being fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use a transfer learning technique to use the existing robust CNN models. In particular, the VGG-16 and CaffeNet models are investigated in the paper.

With this situation, applications of Personal Computer (PC) or smart phone which support healthy life are widespread. Turning to the system dealing with meal information, there are two type systems. One is that meal records are inputted by hand and managed as meal logs. Another one is that a meal image is shot by a smart phone, and meal contents are recorded by image recognition. However, these systems need a lot of time for inputting of meal contents or shooting of meal images. Therefore, it is difficult to continue use. Moreover, the second system has a problem for accuracy of image recognition. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a meal information collection system which uses IoT wireless tags. An IoT wireless tag is corresponded to a meal and the system can automatically get meal information such as meal contents, meal sequence, meal time and so on. We implemented the meal information collection system which aims automatic collection and getting of various information which do not get at other systems.

Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer).

Also, a concept of barrier-coverage has been proved as a promising one applicable to surveillance and security. In this paper, we present collision-free reinforced barriers by heterogeneous UAVs to support multi domain. Then, we define a problem which is to minimize maximum movement of UAVs on condition that a property of collision-free among UAVs is assured while they travel from current positions to specific locations so as to form reinforced barriers within multi domain. Because the defined problem depends on how to locate UAVs on barriers, we develop a novel approach that provides a collision-free movement as well as a creation of virtual lines in multi domain. Furthermore, we address future research topics which should be handled carefully for the barrier-coverage by heterogeneous UAVs.},   keywords={autonomous aerial vehicles;collision avoidance;Internet of Things;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;remotely operated vehicles;collision-free reinforced barriers;multidomain IoT;barrier-coverage;collision-free movement;unmanned aerial vehicle;multiple heterogeneous UAV;maximum movement minimization;Internet of Things;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Collision avoidance;Monitoring;Smart cities;Computer science;Unmanned aerial vehicles},   doi={10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249047},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Inspired by the future possibilities of connected everyday devices, we envision a peripheral activity-based awareness system that captures human activity information and renders this information to enhance context awareness and support social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Leveraging ambient intelligence and IoT technologies, ambient displays can convey activity information in the periphery of our attention. In particular, light has been used as a means to display ambient information and there is scientific evidence that it can enhance well-being, interconnectedness, and improve productivity. In this paper, we undertake two studies, first through an exploratory study we investigate the features of light suitable for conveying subtle activity information within the periphery of the users' attention for promoting context awareness. Also, we examine the preferences, perceptions, and interpretations of ambient lighting configurations of prospective caregiver's for conveying the activity information of older adults. In a second study, we assess the implications of activity awareness through lighting on cognitive performance, moods, and social connectedness. The set-up and design decisions of the second study were partly informed by previous research and by the outcomes of the first experiment. Together, these studies provide additional design guidelines for representing activity information with ambient lighting and highlight potential benefits and usage possibilities for lighting displays within the AAL domain. Furthermore, the results indicate a significant effect of activity awareness on cognitive performance. However, there were no significant effects of activity awareness through lighting on moods and social connectedness. Finally, we discuss the design guidelines and implications of these findings for designing activity-based ambient lighting displays for AAL environments.},   keywords={ambient intelligence;assisted living;body area networks;cognition;Internet of Things;telemedicine;ambient assisted living environments;Internet of Things;cognitive performance;moods;social connectedness;peripheral activity awareness;ambient lighting displays;Lighting;Encoding;Design methodology;Context-aware services;Senior citizens;Context;Green products;Ambient intelligence;ambient displays;ambient lighting;ambient assisted living;perception;context awareness;social connectedness},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2703866},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

On the contrary, this scientific work aims propose an alternative approach based on big data analytics coming from the sensors of robotic rehabilitation devices in order to improve the patient’s therapy in the perspective of a healthcare Cloud of Things (CoT) scenario. We perform an exploratory analysis considering big data coming from sensors installed in Lokomat, i.e., one of the major robotic rehabilitation devices, in order to study the data model and the predictors that will allow clinical operators to forecast the best treatment personalizing the therapy. Data analysis proves that there are moderate correlations among features referring to stance and swing biofeedbacks of hip and knee. From the analytical point of view, these values may approximate the stance and swing phases of knee and hip.

Thus, indoor climate monitoring and management are prevalent in many places, from public offices to residential houses. Our previous research has shown that an active plant wall system can effectively reduce the concentrations of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds and stabilize the carbon dioxide concentration in an indoor environment. However, regular plant care is restricted by geography and can be costly in terms of time and money, which poses a significant challenge to the widespread deployment of plant walls. In this paper, we propose a remote monitoring and control system that is specific to the plant walls. The system utilizes the Internet of Things technology and the Azure public cloud platform to automate the management procedure, improve the scalability, enhance user experiences of plant walls, and contribute to a green indoor climate.},   keywords={air pollution control;air quality;carbon compounds;civil engineering computing;cloud computing;condition monitoring;environmental science computing;indoor environment;Internet of Things;vegetation;walls;green indoor climate;indoor climate monitoring;active plant wall system;volatile organic compounds;carbon dioxide concentration;remote monitoring;Azure public cloud platform;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Meteorology;ZigBee;Data visualization;Servers;Wireless fidelity;Internet of Things;Azure cloud;IoT hub;remote monitoring and control;plant wall system},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847440},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management. Moreover, a prototype of mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems is presented with experimental results to justify the proposed concept.},   keywords={electronic money;Internet of Things;mobile computing;mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems;future mobile Internet-of-Things systems;decentralized data management framework;Bitcoin digital currency;blockchain applications;resource-limited mobile devices;mobile services;edge computing resource management;proof-of-work puzzles;multiple access mobile edge computing;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Data mining;Bitcoin;Servers;Heterogeneous networks;Internet of Things;Multiaccess communication},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1701095},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={August},}

Several IIoT applications such as the ones related to healthcare systems are expected to widely utilize the evolving 5G technology. This 5G-inspired IIoT paradigm in healthcare applications enables the users to interact with various types of sensors via secure wireless medical sensor networks (WMSNs). Users of 5G networks should interact with each other in a seamless secure manner. And thus, security richness is highly coveted for the real time wireless sensor network systems. Asking users to verify themselves before every interaction is a tedious, time-consuming process that disrupts inhabitants' activities, and degrades the overall healthcare system performance. To avoid such problems, we propose a context-sensitive seamless identity provisioning (CSIP) framework for the IIoT.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is now transitioning from theory to practice. This means that a lot of data will be generated and the management of this data is going to be a big challenge. To transform IoT into reality and build upon realistic and more useful services, better resource management is required at the perception layer. In this regard, Fog computing plays a very vital role. With the advent of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) and remote healthcare and monitoring, quick response time and latency minimization are required. However, the receiving nodes have a very fluctuating behavior in resource consumption especially if they are mobile. Fog, a localized cloud placed close to the underlying IoTs, provides the means to cater such issues by analyzing the behavior of the nodes and estimating resources accordingly. Similarly, Service Level Agreement (SLA) management and meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements also become issues. In this paper, we devise a methodology, referred to as MEdia FOg Resource Estimation (MeFoRE), to provide resource estimation on the basis of service give-up ratio, also called Relinquish Rate (RR), and enhance QoS on the basis of previous Quality of Experience (QoE) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) records.

 title={Compact Hardware Implementation of a SHA-3 Core for Wireless Body Sensor Networks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={40128-40136},   abstract={One of the most important Internet of Things applications is the wireless body sensor network (WBSN), which can provide universal health care, disease prevention, and control. Due to large deployments of small scale smart sensors in WBSNs, security, and privacy guarantees (e.g., security and safety-critical data, sensitive private information) are becoming a challenging issue because these sensor nodes communicate using an open channel, i.e., Internet. We implement data integrity (to resist against malicious tampering) using the secure hash algorithm 3 (SHA-3) when smart sensors in WBSNs communicate with each other using the Internet. Due to the limited resources (i.e., storage, computation, and communication capabilities) of sensors in WBSNs, a lightweight implementation of SHA-3 is needed. To address this challenge, we propose a new implementation of the SHA-3, which has a compact hardware architecture. Our implementation of SHA-3 consists of a reliable logic structure, random access memory, and an enhanced finite state machine. The simulation on a Vitrtex-5 field programmable gate array shows that the proposed implementation is suitable for the WBSN on different applications.

In IoVs, regular exchange of current position, direction, velocity, etc., enables mobile vehicles to predict an upcoming accident and alert the human drivers in time or proactively take precautionary actions to avoid the accident. The actualization of this concept requires the use of channel access protocols that can guarantee reliable and timely broadcast of safety messages. This paper investigates the application of network coding concept to increase content of every transmission and achieve improved broadcast reliability with less number of retransmission. In particular, we proposed Code Aided Retransmission-based Error Recovery (CARER) scheme, introduced an RTB/CTB handshake to overcome hidden node problem and reduce packets collision rate. The performance of CARER is clearly shown with detailed theoretical analysis and further validated with simulation experiments.},   keywords={access protocols;air pollution control;broadcast communication;intelligent transportation systems;Internet of Things;network coding;road accidents;road safety;telecommunication network reliability;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless channels;message broadcast reliability improvement;Internet of Vehicle;IoV;Internet of Things;intelligent transportation system;ITS;transport safety;air pollution reduction;transportation comfort enhancement;road accident reduction;channel access protocol;network coding concept application;code aided retransmission-based error recovery scheme;CARER scheme;RTB-CTB handshake;packets collision rate reduction;VANET;Vehicles;Reliability;Safety;Accidents;Intelligent vehicles;Roads;Network coding;VANET;Broadcast;DSRC;MAC;XOR},   doi={10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.343},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

However, with this broader connectivity, new vulnerabilities and attack vectors are being introduced, increasing opportunities for systems to be compromised by hackers and targeted attacks. These vulnerabilities pose severe threats to a myriad of IoT applications within areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, power and energy grids, transportation and commercial building management. While embedded OEMs offer technologies, such as hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM), that deploy strong chain-of-trust and authentication mechanisms, still they struggle to protect against vulnerabilities introduced by vendors and end users, as well as additional threats posed by potential technical vulnerabilities and zero-day attacks. This paper proposes a pro-active policy-based approach, enforcing the principle of least privilege, through hardware Security Policy Engine (SPE) that actively monitors communication of applications and system resources on the system communication bus (ARM AMBA-AXI4). Upon detecting a policy violation, for example, a malicious application accessing protected storage, it counteracts with predefined mitigations to limit the attack. The proposed SPE approach widely complements existing embedded hardware and software security technologies, targeting the mitigation of risks imposed by unknown vulnerabilities of embedded applications and protocols.},   keywords={authorisation;computer network security;embedded systems;Internet of Things;platform module;secure IoT technologies;malicious application;hardware security policy engine;embedded applications;software security technologies;embedded hardware;SPE approach;policy violation;system communication bus;system resources;pro-active policy;zero-day attacks;potential technical vulnerabilities;additional threats;end users;authentication mechanisms;chain-of-trust;commercial building management;IoT applications;attack vectors;business operations;supply chain efficiencies;quality control;FPGA;MPSoC;Root-of-trust;ARM TrustZone},   doi={10.1049/cp.2018.0010},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Ultra-low-power design is a challenging area for these battery-operated wearable devices, where the energy supply is limited and hardware resources are scarce. Some biomedical applications tolerate small errors in the values of the biosignal or small degradation in the quality, which can be exploited to reduce the energy requirements. This paper presents an approximate compression technique for biosignals in a wearable healthcare monitoring system. It takes advantage of error tolerance in biosignals and finds the shortest code to compress the data while keeping the error in an acceptable range. Our approximate compressor does not demand any hardware modification and thus can be used in existing wearable devices. The proposed approach for reducing the size of the Huffman table can save 1 MBit storage, on average. It also makes our approximate compressor suitable for runtime adaptation, i.e. creating a new Huffman table based on updated values. Compared to state-of-the-art, our experimental results show up to 60% reduction in data size that is to be transmitted via radio. As wireless communication contributes significantly to the total energy consumption of wearable devices, this improvement can increase the battery lifetime of our healthcare monitoring prototype from 7 days to 10 days.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wearable biomedical healthcare monitoring systems;wearable personal healthcare monitoring systems;ultralow-power design;battery-operated wearable devices;energy supply;hardware resources;biosignal compressor;compression technique;Huffman table;wireless communication;wearable device energy consumption;Electrocardiography;Approximation methods;Biomedical monitoring;Medical services;Monitoring;Encoding;Histograms;Biomedical Healthcare;Wearable Devices;Approximate Computing;Compression;Internet of Things;IoT},   doi={10.1109/CODESISSS.2015.7331376},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

The target of learning two projection matrices is to maximize the inter-class data and minimize the intra-class data. Meanwhile, we propose the class-constrained regularization which enforces the neighboring samples with the same class to be still close to each other so as to further improve the discrimination of CTLDA. The class-constrained regularization possesses two strategies, i.e., hard constraint and soft constraint.

IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of “Internet of health sensor things”. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information.

Access to the data produced by this world can both be beneficial and have drawbacks to society. This data potentially represents the activities of millions of individuals and their possessions collected by billions of "things'. Aggregations of this data can be analyzed through the Internet and Clouds. This raises possible privacy, security, moral and ethical challenges whose solutions will require flexible protection mechanisms. How do we "acquire" and "distribute" data at the IoT world scale while retaining the rights of individuals and organizations to protect, use, and share their data? Clearly a well-defined mechanism and control needs to regulate access to the data and its aggregations. Our paper describes a user-centric multi-level multiple granularity mechanism to share the data from these devices to people and organizations. Revisiting the fundamental mechanisms in security for providing protection, our solution uses capabilities, access lists, and access rights following well-understood formal notions for reasoning about access. Our contribution is to describe an auditable, transparent, distributed, decentralized, publication-subscription based, robust mechanism and automation of these ideas in the IoT realm that is well-matched to the current generation of clouds. It is based on well-tested principles and practices used in crypto currencies exploiting block chains of transactions.

By using information generated by smart switches, senior citizens are not forced to use wearables, change the battery or feel privacy invasion from cameras. Our solution adopts the statistical-based algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). By adding constrains to reduce the high variances of the mixture model and recursively removing the extremely-low probability data from the model, a more accurate mixture model can be constructed.

  year={2018},   volume={8},   number={2},   pages={211-220},   abstract={Early detection of disease is essential for an efficient treatment. Bone loss can be detected and monitored by regular measurement of serum or urine C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx-1). Therefore, rapid, portable, and low-cost point-of-care devices are highly desirable. In this paper, we have reported an Internet of Things (IoT)-based selective, sensitive, quick, and inexpensive device for the quantification of CTx-1 levels in serum. A capacitive interdigital sensor was coated with artificial antibodies, prepared by molecular imprinting technology. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evaluate the resistive and capacitive properties of the sample solutions. A microcontroller-based system was developed for the measurement of the level of CTx-1 in serum and for data transmission to an IoT-based cloud server. The data can be provided to the medical practitioner and a detailed investigation can start for early detection and treatment.

Due to a busy schedule and irregular lifestyle, health hazard is not an age-dependent factor in the recent era. Under these circumstances, Internet of Things has provided a much easier solution for remote real-time health monitoring of patients from the hospital as well as home. Sensors acquire the data of various parameters regarding patients' health, and the Internet of Things stores that data and displays through the website, which provides access for remote monitoring. Use of Sensor reduces the human error, and the size of the system reduces the occupied space of the room. The unique part of this proposed solution is the alarm generation to provide the prescribed medicine to the patient in time. The other beneficial area of the system is the scheme of sending the notification through email and SMS alert if any of the health parameters crosses the threshold value. Notification scheme will keep the respective authority conscious of the situation. Another significant area of the proposed solution is to create the optimum surroundings as per the requirement of patient's health condition.

Certain environments are proposed that are smart and self aware by direct communication between devices of various types that are part of the IoT. One category of devices such as the Low Power Lossy networks (LLNs) consists of numerous small sensors and low power devices as building block elements in IoT. The ROLL working group at Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT) has designed the Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) which is the core of the IoT protocol stack used for communication between these low-power devices. To our knowledge experimentation and evaluation of RPL is very much needed and not much done so far. A few simulation tools exist which enable evaluation of RPL for a realistic deployment scenario. This paper focuses on understanding of the architecture and protocol stack of RPL and thereby its place in IoT. The performance of RPL is carried out for a Smart Health environment scenario by the simulations done in the Contiki OS Cooja simulator with respect to the performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, latency, signalling overhead and energy consumption.

Intellectual deterioration, decreased psychomotor performance, behavior, and personality disorders are some of the consequences of OSA. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of this disorder is a critical need in healthcare solutions. There are several systems for OSA detection. Nevertheless, despite their promising results, these systems not guiding their treatment. For these reasons, this research presents an innovative system for both to detect and support of treatment of OSA of elderly people by monitoring multiple factors such as sleep environment, sleep status, physical activities, and physiological parameters as well as the use of open data available in smart cities. Our system architecture performs two types of processing. On the one hand, a pre-processing based on rules that enables the sending of real-time notifications to responsible for the care of elderly, in the event of an emergency situation. This pre-processing is essentially based on a fog computing approach implemented in a smart device operating at the edge of the network that additionally offers advanced interoperability services: technical, syntactic, and semantic. On the other hand, a batch data processing that enables a descriptive analysis that statistically details the behavior of the data and a predictive analysis for the development of services, such as predicting the least polluted place to perform outdoor activities. This processing uses big data tools on cloud computing. The performed experiments show a 93.3% of effectivity in the air quality index prediction to guide the OSA treatment. The system's performance has been evaluated in terms of latency. The achieved results clearly demonstrate that the pre-processing of data at the edge of the network improves the efficiency of the system.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;open systems;patient monitoring;sleep;real-time monitoring;healthcare solutions;OSA detection;innovative system;elderly people;sleep environment;physical activities;physiological parameters;open data;smart cities;real-time notifications;fog computing approach;smart device operating;batch data processing;predictive analysis;outdoor activities;performed experiments;air quality index prediction;OSA treatment;smart system;sleep monitoring;integrating IoT;obtrusive sleep apnea;important sleep disorders;direct adverse impact;intellectual deterioration;personality disorders;Big Data tools;psychomotor performance;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Computer architecture;Big Data;Sensors;Internet-of-Things;big data;interoperability;sleep monitoring;health monitoring;open data;fog computing;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849822},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2962-2965},   abstract={Rapid advancements of sensing and mobile technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to empower smart and connected healthcare. Realizing the full potential of connected care depends, however, to a great extent on the capability of data analytics. Our previous study proposed a next-generation mobile health system, namely, the Internet of Heart (IoH). The IoH embeds patients into a dynamic network, where the distance between network nodes is determined by the dissimilarity of patients' conditions. Dynamics of the network reveal the change of clinical status of patients. However, it poses a great challenge for real-time recognition of disease patterns when a considerably large number of patients are involved in the IoH. In this present investigation, we develop a novel scheme to optimize the network in a parallel, distributed manner, thereby improving the efficiency of computation. First, a stochastic gradient descent approach is designed to embed patients with similar conditions into a local network. Second, local networks are optimally pieced together to obtain a global network. As opposed to directly embed all patients into one network, the proposed scheme distributes the network optimization into multiple processors for parallel computing. This, in turn, enables the IoH to handle large amount of patients and timely recognize disease patterns in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, e.g., it achieves 80-fold faster than conventional algorithms for optimizing a network with 20000 patients. The developed scheme is effective and efficient for realizing smart connected healthcare in large-scale IoH contexts.},   keywords={cardiology;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;pattern recognition;smart phones;stochastic processes;map reduce;large-scale dynamic network;Internet-of-hearts;sensing technology;mobile technology;smart connected healthcare;data analytics;mobile health system;disease pattern recognition;stochastic gradient descent approach;global network;network optimization;multiple processors;parallel computing;Parallel processing;Sensors;Program processors;Monitoring;Cardiac disease;Computational complexity;Algorithms;Heart;Humans;Internet;Stochastic Processes;Telemedicine},   doi={10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591351},   ISSN={1558-4615},   month={Aug},}

 title={Multipliers-Driven Perturbation of Coefficients for Low-Power Operation in Reconfigurable FIR Filters}, 
  year={2017},   volume={64},   number={9},   pages={2388-2400},   abstract={Reconfigurable finite-impulse response (FIR) filters are one of the most widely implemented components in Internet of Things systems that require flexibility to support several target applications while consuming the minimum amount of power to comply with the strict design requirements of portable devices. Due to the significant power consumption in the multiplier components of the FIR filter, various techniques aimed at reducing the switching activity of these multipliers have been proposed in the literature. However, these techniques rarely exploit the flexibility on the algorithmic level, which can lead to additional benefits. In this paper, FIR filter multipliers are extensively characterized with power simulations, providing a methodology for the perturbation of the coefficients of baseline filters at the algorithm level to trade-off reduced power consumption for filter quality. The proposed optimization technique does not require any hardware overhead and it enables the possibility of scaling the power consumption of the filter at runtime, while ensuring the full baseline performance of any programmed filter whenever it is required. The analyzed FIR filters were fabricated in a 28nm FD-SOI test chip and measured at a near-threshold, 600mV supply voltage. For example, by carefully choosing slightly perturbed coefficients in a low-pass configuration, power savings of up to 33% are achieved when accepting a 3dB degradation on the stopband, as compared with the baseline implementation of the filter.},   keywords={FIR filters;Internet of Things;optimisation;perturbation techniques;power consumption;silicon-on-insulator;power savings;FD-SOI test chip;programmed filter;hardware overhead;optimization technique;filter quality;baseline filters;switching activity;power consumption;Internet of Things systems;reconfigurable finite-impulse response filters;reconfigurable FIR filters;low-power operation;multipliers-driven perturbation;size 28 nm;voltage 600 mV;Finite impulse response filters;Power demand;Switches;Adders;Runtime;Topology;Degradation;VLSI signal processing;FIR filters;digital multipliers;low-power design;approximate computing},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2017.2698138},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={Sept},}

Mashup applications support new services, such as environmental monitoring.

However, mashup, different data sets from multiple sources, is a privacy hazard as it might reveal citizens specific behaviors in different regions. In this paper, we present our efforts to build a cognitive-based middleware for private data mashup (CMPM) to serve a centralized environmental monitoring service. The proposed middleware is equipped with concealment mechanisms to preserve the privacy of the merged data sets from multiple IoMT networks involved in the mashup application. In addition, we presented an IoT-enabled data mashup service, where the multimedia data are collected from the various IoMT platforms, and then fed into an environmental deep learning service in order to detect interesting patterns in hazardous areas. The viable features within each region were extracted using a multiresolution wavelet transform, and then fed into a discriminative classifier to extract various patterns.

Smart home applications have benefited from interactions and data transmissions among different devices over the integrated network with or without human interventions. However, like other technologies, smart home likely introduces new security vulnerabilities due to its dynamic and open nature of connectivity with heterogeneous features. Among such vulnerabilities, is the breach of confidentiality which needs to be addressed urgently as data exchanged between smart home devices can contain crucial information related to user's privacy and safety. However, some of the challenges in providing smart home system with confidentiality service are the flexibility of key management and efficiency of computation and communication. These challenges should be addressed carefully as many small and resource-constrained devices are usually involved in smart home systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a lightweight encryption scheme for smart homes. This scheme will provide users and smart objects with confidentiality service without incurring much overhead cost associated with computation and communication. Our proposed scheme also supports flexible public key management through adopting identity-based encryption, which does not require complex certificate handling. We provide a formal security analysis of our scheme and a performance simulation study. The simulation shows that our scheme provides favorable level of efficiency in terms of overhead cost associated with computation and communication.},   keywords={cryptography;data communication;data privacy;domestic appliances;electronic data interchange;home computing;Internet of Things;lightweight encryption;smart home system;Internet of Things;IoT;home appliances;data transmissions;data exchange;user privacy;user safety;security analysis;identity-based encryption;Smart Home;Internet of Things;Security;Identity-Based Encryption;Lightweight Encryption;IoT},   doi={10.1109/ARES.2016.40},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

With reduced payment penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions, hospitals have increased their focus on managing post discharge care. With the emphasis on prevention and proactive care, integrated approaches that have the ability to collect relevant data from patients, process it efficiently and timely and predict risk patterns in advance and enable seamless collaboration between the patients and the care team is required. This allows care teams to proactively manage the care of the patient and limit complications and readmissions. Internet of things enabled collaborative cloud based e-health is evolving as one of the key transformation approaches in helping to address the 30 day readmission avoidance efforts. While the sensors provide critical data, there are significant constraints in terms of processing, power, storage and overall context. The power and capabilities of the cloud can augment the local visibility of sensors by providing capabilities that the sensors lack. In this work, we define these capabilities as the five P's: Provisioning, Policy Management, Processing, Protection and Prediction. We argue that by bringing these elements together, the e-health architecture is able to take the data from sensors securely and transfer it to the cloud and generate insights and actions that help improve healthcare outcomes in a timely manner. The Cloud management plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and availability of vital information. The blind spots in the unavailability of data or compromised data can result in missed opportunities for proactive care; ours proposed architecture ensures data availability, processing availability and integrity and thus is very important in a 30 day readmission context.},   keywords={cloud computing;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient care;risk analysis;data availability;loT enabled cloud based e-health;US healthcare affordable care act;30 day readmission protection program;care quality;hospitals;post discharge;reduced payment penalties;post discharge care;proactive care;risk patterns;Internet of things;readmission avoidance efforts;e-health architecture;healthcare outcomes;data unavailability;compromised data;Context;Electronic mail;Wide area networks;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Sensors;Collaboration;Cloud;Management;Internet of things;e-health;Predictive Analytics;Sensors;Policy;M2M;30 day readmission},   doi={10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257621},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

With the increasing number of visually impaired people, including the blind, the elderly, and patients with eye diseases, it is vital to help them explore their outside environment with the assistance of smart technologies so that they can adapt to the environment more easily. The smart indoor anti-collision system is one typical application. Previous works normally use video monitors or deployed sensors to provide outside environment information for visually impaired people. However, these methods suffer from privacy disclosure and inconvenience. In this article, we present IAAS, a smart indoor anti-collision system based on RFID, which identifies and tracks passive RFID tags by analyzing the received backscatter signals. We extract RSSI based on the LWLR algorithm and phase profiles as fingerprints to help the user guide from obstacles without observations of eyes.

One strategy that has drawn significant research attention is a focus on remote health monitoring systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This concept can help decrease pressure on hospital systems and healthcare providers, reduce healthcare costs, and improve homecare especially for patients with chronic diseases and the elderly. This paper explores the use of IoT-based applications in medical field and proposes an IoT Tiered Architecture (IoTTA) towards an approach for transforming sensor data into real-time clinical feedback. This approach considers a range of aspects including sensing, sending, processing, storing, and mining and learning.

However, the mobility of mobile users and the limited coverage of edge servers can result in significant network performance degradation, dramatic drop in QoS, and even interruption of ongoing edge services; therefore, it is difficult to ensure service continuity. Service migration has great potential to address the issues, which decides when or where these services are migrated following user mobility and the changes of demand. In this paper, two conceptions similar to service migration, i.e., live migration for data centers and handover in cellular networks, are first discussed. Next, the cutting-edge research efforts on service migration in MEC are reviewed, and a devisal of taxonomy based on various research directions for efficient service migration is presented. Subsequently, a summary of three technologies for hosting services on edge servers, i.e., virtual machine, container, and agent, is provided.

Cyber Physical Systems, Systems of Systems, Internet of Things, Industrie 4.0, Swarm Systems and The Fog are all sectors that attract massive attention from the research communities and massive investment from industry. These concepts are tightly intertwined and describe a movement towards a fully interconnected planet where billions of devices interact via a complex mesh of wireless and wired communication infrastructures. The most compelling vision for the future of technology and industry is one where a swarm of devices is connected with the cloud to provide platforms for myriad of new applications. In this new world, new companies will arise and established ones will have to change radically their business model. The increasing sophistication and heterogeneity of these systems requires radical changes in the way sense-and-control platforms are designed to regulate them. In this presentation, I highlight some of the design challenges due to the complexity, heterogeneity and power consumption of CPS. Indeed, low power consumption is an essential requirement for the swarm of devices especially in the domain of wearable devices for healthcare.

Nevertheless, the high-power costs of communication per distance unit lead to poor technical solutions, particularly in terms of flexibility and efficiency. A future of devices connected through an Internet of Things (IoT) network will require billions of sensors that will affect costs and increase the energy requirements if not equipped with backscattering technologies such as RFID. This work shows how a quantum tunneling RFID tag enables the use of RFIDs in new applications by minimizing battery waste and by drastically improving the range of backscattering systems. The highly sensitive 5.8 GHz quantum tunneling RFID tag achieves backscattering free space ranges above 1.2 km while consuming biasing powers as low as 20.4 μW. This is over 10 times higher than the maximum range of a semi-passive 5.8 GHz RFID ideal link. The quantum tunneling tag is characterized by return gains as high as 35 dB, a simple RF front-end, a sensitivity of -84 dBm, and increasing SNRs for increasing RF impinging powers. This work lays out the basis for both entrepreneurial and research activities that will lead to a new class of long-range backscattering passive sensors with power consumption far lower than traditional radios.},   keywords={Internet of Things;quantum communication;radiofrequency identification;tunnelling;wireless sensor networks;backscattering communications;quantum tunneling RFID tag;sensor networks;radio-equipped drones;Internet of Things;IoT network;backscattering systems;SNR;power consumption;frequency 5.8 GHz;Backscatter;Radiofrequency identification;Tunneling;Antenna measurements;Voltage measurement;Modulation;Gain;RFID;reflection amplifier;tunnel diode;low powered RFID;modulation factor;quantum tunneling tag;quantum tunneling reflector},   doi={10.1109/RFID.2017.7945581},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

IoT has many applications in building smart cities, smart environment, e-health care, etc. Due to the presence of unreliable internet and new routing protocols for low-power devices, IoT requires innovative security solutions. In this paper, we present three new Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for IoT: 1) K-means clustering unsupervised learning based IDS; 2) decision tree based supervised IDS; and 3) a hybrid two stage IDS that combines K-means and decision tree learning approaches. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first machine learning based IDSs (together called as ML-IDS) for IoT. All the three IDS are centralized and scalable approaches. The K-means approach achieves 70-93% detection rate for varying sizes of random IoT networks. Decision tree based IDS achieves 71-80% detection rate and the hybrid approach attains 71-75% detection rate for the same network sizes. Although the hybrid IDS obtains lower detection rate, it is more accurate than the other two approaches. The hybrid approach eliminates the false positives significantly, while the other two IDS suffer from a higher number of false positives. Similar results are also obtained for regular mesh, star and ring topologies of IoT networks, each comprising 16 nodes.},   keywords={computer network security;decision trees;Internet;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning;Intrusion Detection Systems;supervised IDS;machine learning;ML-IDS;low-power embedded devices;decision tree learning;wormhole attack detection;K-means clustering unsupervised learning;Internet of Things;IoT network security;Routing;Decision trees;Internet of Things;Security;Topology;Monitoring;Network topology;Internet of Things (IoT);security;machine learning;intrusion detection systems},   doi={10.1109/IntelliSys.2017.8324298},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Even if it is not a complete solution for a scalable IoT architecture but the time sensitive IoT applications (e-healthcare, real time monitoring, etc.) will profit from the MEC architecture. Furthermore, IoT can extend this paradigm to other areas (e.g. Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks) with the use of Software Defined Network (SDN) orchestration to cope with the challenges hindering the IoT real deployment, as we will illustrate in this paper.},   keywords={cloud computing;Internet of Things;mobile computing;mobile edge computing;Internet of Things;IT worlds;telecom worlds;telecom market;virtualization revolution;cloud computing;IaaS;infrastructure as a service;cloud capabilities;mobile phones usage;mobile applications;world of things;wearables;home automation systems;sensors;RFID tags;IoT architecture;IoT applications;e-healthcare;real time monitoring;MEC architecture;vehicular ad-hoc networks;software defined network;SDN;Cloud computing;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Computer architecture;Bandwidth;Mobile handsets;MEC;SDN;IoT;Fog computing;Cloud computing;NFV},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389122},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly gaining impact on our daily lives. They are finding a wide range of applications in various domains, such as health-care, environmental monitoring, etc. In future, WSNs are expected to be integrated into the Internet of Things (IoT). The integrity of the sensed data is of primary importance in WSN and IoT applications. However, WSN platforms always have very limited resources in terms of battery power, computing and memory. Therefore, it is a key challenge to design an energy-friendly, lightweight digital signature algorithm for WSN platforms. In this paper, we present precomputation methods for Unbalanced Oil-Vinegar (UOV) signature scheme by exploiting the energy harvesting capabilities of WSN to enhance the performance of UOV signature. In addition, we combine circulant method with precomputation in UOV signature to further reduce the energy cost. Meanwhile, circulant method reduces the size and the memory overhead of the precomputation tuple. This increases the availability of precomputation and greatly enhances the availability of the overflow energy. By integrating the above optimization methods, the cost of UOV signature in a WSN node can be reduced by 93%. This greatly enhances the performance of UOV signature, making it feasible for the practical deployment on resource-constrained wireless sensor platforms.},   keywords={Wireless sensor networks;Oils;Sensors;Energy harvesting;Matrices;Digital signatures;Energy harvesting;UOV;Precomputation;IoT and WSNs security},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873288},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={17525-17533},   abstract={In recent years, bicycles have quickly become one of the major urban sports. At the same time, with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded system combine IoT devices are widely used and making computing truly ubiquitous. Although bicycles have various functions, they fail to provide cyclists with sufficient exercise-related information and post-exercise analysis. Therefore, this paper introduced a bicycle record system of ground conditions based on IoT which is combining smartphone and embedded system. The event data recorder comprised two parts, a “smartphone-based event data recorder”and “bicycle-based real-time information feedback system". Using the event data recorder, this paper integrated and provided various types of real-time information for cyclists while they cycled to help them achieve their desired exercise results. After cycling, the cyclists could view cycling-related information through software analysis. This information included cycling routes taken, total cycling distance, and total calories burned. The event data recorder also saved information related to cycling routes, such as acceleration, deceleration, directional changes, and slope changes. By analyzing the recorded information, cyclists not only gained further insight into their exercise results but were also able to share cycling-related information through the Internet, which would benefit cyclists who had not cycled along this route before. By developing the bicycle record system, this paper aimed to provide cyclists with real-time, accurate, and complete information, enabling them to enjoy a consummate cycling environment.},   keywords={bicycles;data recording;embedded systems;health care;information systems;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;program diagnostics;radionavigation;smart phones;sport;ground conditions;IoT devices;cyclists;post-exercise analysis;embedded system;cycling routes;total cycling distance;complete information;Internet of Things;real-time bicycle record system;urban sports;exercise-related information;smartphone-based event data recorder;bicycle-based real-time information feedback system;software analysis;ubiquitous computing;Real-time systems;Bicycles;Compass;Sensors;Global Positioning System;System integration;Embedded systems;Bicycles;Internet of Things;cellular phones;embedded software;event detector},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2740419},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has promoted many battery-powered emerging applications such as smart home, environmental monitoring, and human healthcare monitoring, where energy management is of particular importance. Meanwhile, there is an accelerated tendency towards mobility of IoT devices, either being transported by humans or being mobile by itself. Existing energy management mechanisms for battery-powered IoT fail to consider the two significant characteristics of IoT: the approximate real-time computation, and the mobility of IoT devices, resulting in unnecessary energy waste and network lifetime decay. In this paper, we explore mobility-aware network lifetime maximization for battery-powered IoT applications that perform approximate real-time computation under the Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraint. The proposed scheme is composed of offline and online stages. At offline stage, an optimal mobility-aware task schedule that maximizes network lifetime is derived by using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) technique. Redundant executions due to mobility-incurred overlapping of a single task on different IoT devices are avoided for energy savings. At online stage, a performance-guaranteed and time-efficient QoS-adaptive heuristic based on cross-entropy method is developed to adapt task execution to the fluctuating QoS requirements. Extensive simulations based on synthetic applications and real-life benchmarks have been implemented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique can achieve up to 169.52% network lifetime improvement compared to benchmarking solutions.},   keywords={Task analysis;Quality of service;Energy management;Real-time systems;Optimization;Performance evaluation;Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);network lifetime optimization;approximate real-time computation;Quality-of-Service (QoS);mobility.},   doi={10.1109/TCAD.2018.2873239},   ISSN={0278-0070},   month={},}

We discuss on which level of the network such fog computing tasks can be executed, and provide tradeoffs with respect to requirements relevant to healthcare. Our review indicates that: 1) there is a significant number of computing tasks in healthcare that require or can benefit from fog computing principles; 2) processing on higher network tiers is required due to constraints in wireless devices and the need to aggregate data; and 3) privacy concerns and dependability prevent computation tasks to be completely moved to the cloud.

State-of-the-art solutions mostly focus on the simple scenario with a single person in the open space. Extension to the more realistic realworld scenarios with multiple persons however is non-trivial. Given the much richer interactions among them, the backscattered signals will inevitably mixed, obscuring the information of individual activities. This is further complicated with multi-path in a common indoor environment. In this paper, we however argue that, though often considered harmful, the rich interactions combined with multi-path indeed offer more observable data. After careful processing the raw signals, critical information about the activities can be unveiled through modern learning tools. We present M<sup>2</sup>AI, which for the first time accommodates both multi-path and multi-object for activity identification. M<sup>2</sup>AI incorporates a phase calibration mechanism to automatically eliminate the frequency hopping offsets, and a novel decoupling mechanism for the periodogram and pseduospectrum in the raw signal mixture. The refined data are then fed into an advanced deep-learning engine that integrates a Convolutional Neural Network and a Long Short Term Memory network, which examines both spatial and temporal information in realtime for activity identification. Our M<sup>2</sup>AI is readily deployable using off-the-shelf RFID readers. We have implemented an M<sup>2</sup>AI prototype with Impinj UHF passive tags and a Speedway R420 reader.

Researchers have found critical vulnerabilities such as compromise of private health data, hackers monitoring private conversations via a baby monitor, compromise of a moving internet enabled car or shutting it down altogether while in motion. Attention to security is not increasing at the same rapid pace as the number of IoT devices. Hence, security is beginning to be a major concern with the advent of IoT, connecting numerous devices introducing new attack vectors. This paper is intended to focus on the benefits of integrating security in IoT. The paper begins with design and implementation of a basic Health Monitor for remote monitoring and tracking of pulse rate and body temperature of patients treated in hospitals.

 title={Energy efficient IoT thermometer based on fuzzy logic for fever monitoring}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially Internet of Thing (IoT), has received many attentions from many researchers. In healthcare, IoT has proven in improving the quality of health services. Many IoT-based digital systems, such as WIFI digital thermometer, Telemetry Digital Pacemaker and Remote Digital Blood Pressure, have been developed recently. The systems allow physicians in hospitals to remotely monitor the condition of patients continuously. It enhances the quality of caring for the patients to be anytime and everywhere. However, most of the systems have been developed without considering energy issues. As a result, most of the systems may be suspected wasteful of energy consumption due to data transmission occurs frequently and continuously. In the other hand, research reports on the energy consumption of the systems have not been performed. It causes difficulty in obtaining data on the energy consumption of monitoring fever body temperature. To address these issues, this research develops an IoT-based digital thermometer that is called HI-Thermo. HI-Thermo is an adaptive system that is utilized fuzzy logic to optimize the use of energy on the proposed system. Fuzzy logic saves energy by controlling the transmission interval in Hi-Thermo. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of HI-Thermo; and rigorous data results have been analyzed from the experiments. The results show that HI-Thermo saves energy of monitoring significantly. For fever body temperature monitoring, the proposed system consumes 15% lower than the existing traditional monitoring of body temperature, which does not implement the fuzzy logic.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;fuzzy logic;health care;Internet of Things;pacemakers;patient monitoring;telemetry;thermometers;Remote Digital Blood Pressure;energy issues;energy consumption;data transmission;monitoring fever body temperature;HI-Thermo;adaptive system;fuzzy logic;Hi-Thermo;fever body temperature monitoring;existing traditional monitoring;energy efficient IoT;fever monitoring;Information Communication Technology;health services;digital systems;WIFI digital thermometer;Telemetry Digital Pacemaker;HI;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy logic;Temperature sensors;Temperature distribution;Testing;Healthcare;Monitoring;Digital;Logic fuzzy;Thermometer;IoT},   doi={10.1109/ICoICT.2017.8074640},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

 title={Adaptive Energy-Aware Computation Offloading for Cloud of Things Systems}, 
  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={23947-23957},   abstract={Cloud computing has become the de facto computing platform for application processing in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, limitations of the cloud model, such as the high transmission latency and high costs are giving birth to a new computing paradigm called edge computing (a.k.a fog computing). Fog computing aims to move the data processing close to the network edge so as to reduce Internet traffic. However, since the servers at the fog layer are not as powerful as the ones in the cloud, there is a need to balance the data processing in between the fog and the cloud. Moreover, besides the data offloading issue, the energy efficiency of fog computing nodes has become an increasing concern. Densely deployed fog nodes are a major source of carbon footprint in IoT systems. To reduce the usage of the brown energy resources (e.g. powered by energy produced through fossil fuels), green energy is an alternative option. In this paper, we propose employing dual energy sources for supporting the fog nodes, where solar power is the primary energy supply and grid power is the backup supply. Based on that, we present a comprehensive analytic framework for incorporating green energy sources to support the running of IoT and fog computingbased systems, and to handle the tradeoff in terms of average response time, average monetary, and energy costs in the IoT. This paper describes an online algorithm, Lyapunov optimization on time and energy cost (LOTEC), based on the technique of Lyapunov optimization. LOTEC is a quantified near optimal solution and is able to make control decision on application offloading by adjusting the two-way tradeoff between average response time and average cost. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm by a number of experiments.

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={45-52},   abstract={The global trend of population aging and the continuing maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives the rapid development of health care. In the comprehensive applications of IoT technology, developing and constructing a prediction model for chronic diseases is a great improvement to healthcare technology as well as an exploration of IoT technology on the data-analysis and decision-making level. Considering that early detection, diagnosis and screening of hypertension plays a significant role in the prevention and reduction of the onset of cardiovascular diseases as well as the improvement of quality of life, it is of great value to figure out hypertension-related risk factors and further establish a model for the prediction of hypertension with the identified risk factors. Thus, in this paper, we put forward to integrate logistic regression analysis and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for the selection of risk factors and the prediction of chronic diseases by taking a case study of hypertension. First, binary logistic regression model was applied on experimental dataset collected from Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to select factors statistically significant to hypertension in terms of the pre-defined p-value. Then, a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) neural network model with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm was constructed and trained for the prediction of hypertension with the selected risk factors as inputs to ANNs. Experimental results showed that our proposed approach achieved more than 72% prediction accuracy acceptable in the diagnosis of hypertension and that the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) was more than 0.77. The results indicate that integration of logistic regression and artificial neural networks provides us an effective method in the selection of risk factors and the prediction of hypertension, as well as a general approach for the prediction of other chronic diseases.},   keywords={backpropagation;diseases;medical computing;multilayer perceptrons;patient diagnosis;regression analysis;artificial neural network-based approach;chronic disease prediction model;population aging;Internet of Things;IoT technology;healthcare technology;data-analysis;decision-making level;early hypertension detection;hypertension diagnosis;hypertension screening;cardiovascular diseases;quality of life improvement;hypertension-related risk factors;logistic regression analysis;ANN;binary logistic regression model;behavior risk factor surveillance system;BRFSS;multilayer perception neural network model;MLP neural network model;back propagation;BP algorithm;area under the receiver-operator curve;AUC;Hypertension;Diseases;Predictive models;Logistics;Artificial neural networks;Analytical models;Regression analysis;logistic regression;artifical neural network;hypertension prediction},   doi={10.1109/iThings.2014.16},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={This paper proposes a novel physical-layer-aided security technique for protecting a social Internet of things (SIoT) architecture-based healthcare system. Exploiting the social relationship link between healthcare user (e.g., patients and elderly people) and healthcare provider (e.g., physicians), social networks can play the role of a trusted online platform to establish service application interfaces between healthcare user (HU) and healthcare provider (HP). This enables the Internet of things (IoT) medical devices (e.g., IoT body sensor) to timely share the bio-data of HU with remote HP via the both storage-rich and computational resource-rich social networks. Given the high security requirement on SIoT data sharing and the fact that resource-constrained IoT devices cannot efficiently execute complicated cryptography, a robust and cost-effective two-phase security method is proposed by exploiting the device-specific physical-layer (PHY) attributes. Specifically, the PHY carrier frequency offset and in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance of an IoT device are practically estimated to generate the PHY-ID. Using our PHY-ID, the SIoT HU authentication and the bio-data confidentiality are simultaneously enhanced without posing any additional implementation overhead at IoT body sensors, which is especially applicable for the resource-constrained IoT devices.},   keywords={body sensor networks;computer network security;health care;Internet of Things;social networking (online);bio-data confidentiality;IoT body sensor;PHY-aided secure IoT healthcare system;social relationship link;healthcare user;healthcare provider;trusted online platform;service application interfaces;remote HP;computational resource-rich social networks;SIoT data sharing;novel physical-layer-aided security technique;social Internet of things architecture-based healthcare system;Internet of things medical devices;storage-rich social networks;device-specific physical layer attributes;PHY carrier frequency offset;SIoT HU authentication;PHY-ID;in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance;two-phase security method;resource-constrained IoT devices;Medical services;Estimation;Social network services;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Authentication},   doi={10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288341},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

This survey provides a comprehensive review of such enabling technologies. In particular, we present cellular localization systems including recent results on 5G localization, and solutions based on Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), highlighting those that are capable of computing 3D location in multi-floor indoor environments. We overview range-free localization schemes, which have been traditionally explored in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and are nowadays gaining attention for several envisioned Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={3},   pages={2130-2145},   abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet of Things and cloud computing technologies, smart health (s-health) is expected to significantly improve the quality of health care. However, data security and user privacy concerns in s-health have not been adequately addressed. As a well-received solution to realize fine-grained access control, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has the potential to ensure data security in s-health. Nevertheless, direct adoption of the traditional CP-ABE in s-health suffers two flaws. For one thing, access policies are in cleartext form and reveal sensitive health-related information in the encrypted s-health records (SHRs). For another, it usually supports small attribute universe, which places an undesirable limitation on practical deployments of CP-ABE because the size of its public parameters grows linearly with the size of the universe. To address these problems, we introduce PASH, a privacy-aware s-health access control system, in which the key ingredient is a large universe CP-ABE with access policies partially hidden. In PASH, attribute values of access policies are hidden in encrypted SHRs and only attribute names are revealed. In fact, attribute values carry much more sensitive information than generic attribute names. Particularly, PASH realizes an efficient SHR decryption test which needs a small number of bilinear pairings. The attribute universe can be exponentially large and the size of public parameters is small and constant. Our security analysis indicates that PASH is fully secure in the standard model. Performance comparisons and experimental results show that PASH is more efficient and expressive than previous schemes.},   keywords={authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;electronic health records;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;smart cities;smart health;Internet of Things;cloud computing technologies;health care;data security;user privacy concerns;fine-grained access control;s-health suffers two flaws;access policies;s-health records;public parameters;attribute values;security analysis;ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption;efficient policy-hiding attribute-based access control;s-health;sensitive health-related information;privacy-aware s-health access control system;sensitive information;SHR decryption test;bilinear pairings;mobile health;smart cities;Cloud computing;Hospitals;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Access control;Urban areas;Attribute-based encryption (ABE);decryption test;full security;large universe;privacy protection;smart health (s-health)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2825289},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

Traditional PA recognition techniques focus on repeated aerobic exercises or stationary PA. As a crucial indicator in human health, it covers a range of bodily movement from aerobics to anaerobic that may all bring health benefits. However, existing PA recognition approaches are mostly designed for specific scenarios and often lack extensibility for application in other areas, thereby limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we attempt to detect more gym physical activities (GPAs) in addition to traditional PA using acceleration, A two layer recognition framework is proposed that can classify aerobic, sedentary and free weight activities, count repetitions and sets for the free weight exercises, and in the meantime, measure quantities of repetitions and sets for free weight activities. In the first layer, a one-class SVM (OC-SVM) is applied to coarsely classify free weight and non-free weight activities. In the second layer, a neural network (NN) is utilized for aerobic and sedentary activities recognition; a hidden Markov model (HMM) is to provide a further classification in free weight activities. The performance of the framework was tested on 10 healthy subjects (age: 30 &amp;#x00B1; 5; BMI: 25 &amp;#x00B1; 5.5 kg/m2; body fat: 20.5 &amp;#x00B1; 5.4), and compared with some typical classifiers. The results indicate the proposed framework has better performance in recognizing and measuring GPAs than other approaches. The potential of this framework can be extended in supporting more types of PA recognition in complex applications.},   keywords={Training;Hidden Markov models;Activity recognition;Internet of Things;Artificial neural networks;Medical services;Support vector machines;Internet of things;physical activity recognition;free weight training;wearable sensors.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846359},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Studies have revealed that Fog/Edge Computing (FEC)-based services will play a major role in extending the cloud by carrying out intermediary services at the edge of the network. Fog/Edge Computing-based IoT’s (FECIoT) distributed architecture enhances service provisioning along the Cloud-to-Things continuum, thereby making it suitable for mission-critical applications. Furthermore, the proximity of fog/edge devices to where the data is produced makes it stand-out in terms of resource allocation, service delivery, and privacy. From the business perspective, FECIoT will lead to a boom and spring up of small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), thereby encouraging inclusion for all. To this end, we present a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art IoT literature over the period 2008-2018 and propose the FECIoT framework which covers the enabling technologies, services, and open research issues. A tutorial approach is employed, progressing from basic to more advanced concepts within the IoT domain.

In the view of ever increasing sources of toxic chemicals, these systems should have the facilities to detect and calibrate the source quickly. Toxic gases are the ones that cause health impact but humans are being exposed to it in various situations. These gases have to be monitored such that increase in the normal level of them could be known and proper precaution measures can be undertaken. So, an embedded system is designed using a microcontroller with internet of things, for the purpose of detecting and monitoring the hazardous gas leakage, which aids in the evasion of endangering of human lives. The hazardous gases can be sensed and displayed each and every second, in proximity to one more sensor for tracking heart beats which help to monitor the condition of the sewer labourers. If both the gases along with a pulse detector exceeds the normal level then an alarm is generated immediately and also an alert warning message can be sent to the authorised administrator and as well to the nearest health center to make the sewer labourers feel comfortable with necessary first aid and possibilities with the treatment in the case of emergency. Once the message is received by the health center, they enforce their team with necessary first aid to the current location to save the sewer labourer. Once this system is established for a particular user this will completely become fully automated and does not need any other additional people for monitoring and alerting purpose. It has an advantage over the manual method in offering quick response time and accurate detection of an emergency.},   keywords={gas sensors;wireless sensor networks;biomedical measurement;personnel;health hazards;industrial accidents;wireless sensing system;sewer labourer welfare;environmental pollution monitoring;toxic chemicals;toxic gases;microcontroller;internet of things;hazardous gases;heart beats;pulse detector;alert warning message;health center;first aid;fully automated;quick response time},   doi={10.1049/htl.2017.0017},   ISSN={2053-3713},   month={},}

Sleeping conditions are one of the most influential factors on health. However, the literature lacks of the appropriate simulation tools to widely support the research on the recognition of sleeping postures. This paper proposes an agent-based simulation framework to simulate sleeper movements on a simulated smart bed with load sensors. This framework allows one to define sleeping posture recognition algorithms and compare their outcomes with the poses adopted by the sleeper. This novel presented ABS-BedIoT simulator allows users to graphically explore the results with starplots, evolution charts, and final visual representations of the states of the bed sensors. This simulator can also generate logs text files with big data for applying offline big data techniques on them. The source code of ABS-BedIoT and some examples of logs are freely available from a public research repository. The current approach is illustrated with an algorithm that properly recognized the simulated sleeping postures with an average accuracy of 98%. This accuracy is higher than the one reported by an existing alternative work in this area.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient monitoring;power system simulation;sleep;smart power grids;internet-of-things;healthcare professionals;load sensors;sleeping posture recognition algorithms;ABS-BedIoT simulator;bed sensors;offline big data techniques;smart beds;Big data analytics;remotely monitor patients;agent-based simulation framework;Intelligent sensors;Big Data;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Agent-based-simulation;big data;Internet-of-Things;multi-agent systems;smart bed},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2764467},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={788-793},   abstract={As the world's population of senior citizens continues to grow, the burdens on the professionals who care for them (carers) are also increasing. In nursing homes, carers need to make a daily report for each resident aiming to improve his/her quality of life. However, in the present understaffed situation, it is difficult and burdensome for carers to record the resident's activity in detail since each carer needs to take care of several residents at the same time. In this paper, we propose an automatic daily report generation system which can monitor the activity of multiple residents in nursing homes. Knowing that important activities such as toilet, bathing, rehabilitation and so on take place in specific areas in a nursing home, it is possible to record residents' activities by tracking their stay areas and movement between the areas within the day. Our proposed system estimates stay areas of multiple residents by machine learning for RSSI values that are sent from BLE beacons attached to residents and received at BLE scanners deployed over multiple areas, and records activities of the residents determined based on their estimated stay areas. The proposed system can also output a daily report of each resident based on the recorded data. We carried out a five-day experiment with four elderly participants in a nursing home and evaluated activity estimation accuracy by leave-one-person-out cross-validation. As a result, our proposed system achieved the weighted average F-measure of 81.6%.},   keywords={Medical services;Activity recognition;Servers;Estimation;Smoothing methods;Monitoring;Senior citizens;Healthcare Industrial Internet of Things (HealthI–IoT);Random Forest;Bluetooth Low Energy},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2018.8480348},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={With the pervasiveness of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid progress of wireless communications, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have attracted significant interest from the research community in recent years. As a promising networking paradigm, it is adopted to improve the healthcare services and create a highly reliable ubiquitous healthcare system. However, the flourish of WBANs still faces many challenges related to security and privacy preserving. In such pervasive environment where the context conditions dynamically and frequently change, context-aware solutions are needed to satisfy the users' changing needs. Therefore, it is essential to design an adaptive access control scheme that can simultaneously authorize and authenticate users while considering the dynamic context changes. In this paper, we propose a context-aware access control and anonymous authentication approach based on a secure and efficient Hybrid Certificateless Signcryption (H-CLSC) scheme. The proposed scheme combines the merits of Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Signcryption (CP-ABSC) and Identity-Based Broadcast Signcryption (IBBSC) in order to satisfy the security requirements and provide an adaptive contextual privacy. From a security perspective, it achieves confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, context-aware privacy, public verifiability, and ciphertext authenticity. Moreover, the key escrow and public key certificate problems are solved through this mechanism. Performance analysis demonstrates the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to benchmark schemes in terms of functional security, storage, communication and computational cost.},   keywords={authorisation;body area networks;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;message authentication;mobile radio;telecommunication control;ubiquitous computing;context-aware authorization;wireless body area networks;wireless communications;healthcare services;adaptive access control scheme;context-aware access control;anonymous authentication approach;adaptive contextual privacy;context-aware privacy;ciphertext authenticity;WBAN;ubiquitous healthcare system;Internet of Things;hybrid certificateless signcryption;identity-based broadcast signcryption;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Authentication;Access control;Privacy;Public key},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422397},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

The market is flooded with smart devices which track an individual's footsteps, the exercise regime followed, the calories burnt and many such health parameters. The important criterion often ignored which defines an individual's health is the food consumed. So it is imperative to constantly track what is ingested into the body and its impact on a person's health. The Smart Dietary Monitoring System (SDMS) is essentially a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that provides real time dietary scheduling information. The proposed system can track the user's dietary intake and replenish behavior through sensors. By integrating this WSN into the "Internet of Things", data can be aggregated in the cloud and analyzed using statistical methods which provide the correlation between the user's health and his dietary regime. This health data can be used to track as well as guide the user regarding his nutritional needs thus acting as an ideal health assistant.},   keywords={health care;Internet;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;smart dietary monitoring system;SDMS;wireless sensor network;real time dietary scheduling information;Internet of Things;WSN;ideal health assistant;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee;Monitoring;Sensors;Cloud computing;Standards;Dietary Scheduling;Wireless Sensor networks;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/iNIS.2015.20},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-27},   abstract={While the current generation of mobile and fixed communication networks has been standardized for mobile broadband services, the next generation is driven by the vision of the Internet of Things and mission-critical communication services requiring latency in the order of milliseconds or submilliseconds. However, these new stringent requirements have a large technical impact on the design of all layers of the communication protocol stack. The cross-layer interactions are complex due to the multiple design principles and technologies that contribute to the layers' design and fundamental performance limitations. We will be able to develop low-latency networks only if we address the problem of these complex interactions from the new point of view of submilliseconds latency. In this paper, we propose a holistic analysis and classification of the main design principles and enabling technologies that will make it possible to deploy low-latency wireless communication networks. We argue that these design principles and enabling technologies must be carefully orchestrated to meet the stringent requirements and to manage the inherent tradeoffs between low latency and traditional performance metrics. We also review currently ongoing standardization activities in prominent standards associations, and discuss open problems for future research.},   keywords={Communication networks;Reliability;Mission critical systems;Wireless sensor networks;GSM;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;low-latency communications;mission critical services;ultrareliable communications},   doi={10.1109/JPROC.2018.2863960},   ISSN={0018-9219},   month={},}

Hypertension is an increasing in systolic blood pressure over 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg. Increased blood pressure that lasts for a long time can cause damage to the kidneys (renal failure), heart (coronary heart disease), and brain (causing a stroke). Many hypertension patients with uncontrolled blood pressure. Based on report of the Indonesian Ministry of Health in 2014 regarding hypertension, nationally 25.8% of Indonesia's population suffer from hypertension. A topic that is being discussed is the M2M services in health sector. Utilization of M2M services in health sector is expected to help or improve existing health services. M2M technology connects machines, devices and equipment through various types of communication. This makes the device into a smart device that can communicate with each other. In this paper, we propose design of M2M communication system that are not only monitor the patient, but also can provide medical recommendations. The treatment can be monitored by doctor. In this system, there will be two devices and a mobile application. The first device is sphygmomanometer connected to the microcontroller, the second device is medicine box connected to the microcontroller, and a mobile application.

This provides a set of services for both patients and their caregivers that support the full continuum of the multidimensional care approach of diabetes. The platform's software architecture pattern enables the development of various applications without knowing low-level details of the platform. This is achieved through unifying the access interface and mechanism of handling service requests through a layered approach based on object virtualization and automatic service delivery.

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={53-60},   abstract={In this paper we present the implementation of a WebRTC gateway service that can forward ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic from a browser inside a local hospital network to a browser on a local home network. The gateway leverages the same infrastructure used by the hospital to tunnel sensor and control data for medical devices in home-care deployments. In our use case, doctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on external machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically behind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not between patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all WebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure tunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic from multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that connect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local network to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to change the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well within the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need for any individual host configuration. In our evaluation we show that the latency overhead is 18-20 ms for each concurrent stream added to the same gateway service, which is not discernible with a naked eye until you have more than 10 concurrent streams.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;firewalls;health care;hospitals;Internet;Internet of Things;internetworking;wireless LAN;on-demand IoT device tunneling service;on-demand WebRTC service;WebRTC gateway service;ad-hoc RTP data plane traffic;local hospital network;local home network;tunnel sensor;medical devices;home-care deployments;hospital firewall;external machines;NAT;local WiFi network;VPN solutions;WebRTC traffic;concurrent streams;local gateway services;direct browser-to-browser connection;WebRTC;Logic gates;Browsers;Protocols;Hospitals;Ports (Computers);Standards;webrtc;rtc;palcom;iot;medical applications},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2014.19},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Redox-based Resistive RAM (ReRAM) is a promising NVM technology due to its high density, low leakage power and ability to perform functionally complete set of Boolean operations. The secure transmission of IoT sensory data is of paramount importance to guard confidentiality and authenticity. However, encryption and authentication requires additional computing resources leading to significant performance overhead. An alternative approach, as explored in this current manuscript, is to use the in-memory computing capability of ReRAM. In particular, we study ReRAM based in-memory computing architecture for round function of cryptographic hash algorithm known as SHA-3 or Keccak. Our carefully done mapping reveals a bit/word-serial architecture for SHA-3.

This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification, reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or intentionally.

This paper presents a modular and extensible quadrotor architecture and its specific prototyping for automatic tracking applications. The architecture is extensible and based on off-the-shelf components for easy system prototyping. A target tracking and acquisition application is presented in detail to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the proposed design. Complete design details of the platform are also presented. The designed module implements the basic proportional-integral-derivative control and a custom target acquisition algorithm. Details of the sliding-window-based algorithm are also presented. This algorithm performs $20\times $ faster than comparable approaches in OpenCV with equal accuracy. Additional modules can be integrated for more complex applications, such as search-and-rescue, automatic object tracking, and traffic congestion analysis. A hardware architecture for the newly introduced Better Portable Graphics (BPG) compression algorithm is also introduced in the framework of the extensible quadrotor architecture. Since its introduction in 1987, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) graphics format has been the de facto choice for image compression. However, the new compression technique BPG outperforms the JPEG in terms of compression quality and size of the compressed file. The objective is to present a hardware architecture for enhanced real-time compression of the image. Finally, a prototyping platform of a hardware architecture for a secure digital camera (SDC) integrated with the secure BPG (SBPG) compression algorithm is presented. The proposed architecture is suitable for high-performance imaging in the IoT and is prototyped in Simulink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever proposed hardware architecture for SBPG compression integrated with an SDC.},   keywords={aerospace computing;control engineering computing;data compression;helicopters;image coding;image sensors;Internet of Things;object tracking;robot vision;telecommunication security;three-term control;variable structure systems;high-performance system design;secure image communication;Internet-of-things;image exchange;video exchange;smart health care;smart structures;smart transportations;IoT;modular quadrotor architecture;automatic tracking applications;off-the-shelf components;system prototyping;target tracking application;proportional-integral-derivative control;custom target acquisition algorithm;sliding-window-based algorithm;search-and-rescue;automatic object tracking;traffic congestion analysis;better portable graphics compression algorithm;hardware architecture;secure digital camera;SDC;secure BPG compression algorithm;SBPG compression algorithm;Simulink;Internet of Things;Object detection;Image compression;Video communication;Image coding;Algorithm design and analysis;Target tracking;Compression algorithms;Transform coding;Smart devices;Internet of Things (IoT);Object Detection;Robot Vision Systems;Secure Digital Camera (SDC);Better Portable Graphics (BPG);Image Compression;VLSI Architecture;Internet of things (IoT);object detection;robot vision systems;secure digital camera (SDC);better portable graphics (BPG);image compression;VLSI architecture},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2542800},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

To tackle those problems, the research community has recently turned to Fog Computing.

 title={An Automatic Health Monitoring System for Patients Suffering From Voice Complications in Smart Cities}, 
  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={3900-3908},   abstract={Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},   keywords={cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;signal detection;smart cities;speech processing;running speech;sustained vowel;energy distribution;linear prediction analysis;source signal;automatic voice disorder detection system;healthcare resources;elderly people;smart healthcare systems;smart technologies;cloud computing;Internet of Things;smart cities;voice complications;automatic health monitoring system;frequency 1 Hz to 1562 Hz;Speech;Smart cities;Monitoring;Medical services;Senior citizens;Feature extraction;Acoustics;Smart cities;health monitoring;voice disorders;liner prediction;GMM},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2680467},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={290-296},   abstract={MQTT-SN offers energy efficient data transportation under unreliable wireless environment with limited energy/ bandwidth. However, MQTT-SN faces a new set of challenges for service guarantees when operated for a reliable or time-critical applications. The impact of various network parameters on the MQTT-SN service assurance requires an end-to-end system study, which are unexplored yet. In this paper we analyze in detail about the end-to-end service assurance parameters such as content delivery delay and probability of content delivery for a MQTT-SN to be used in health care Internet of Things (IoT). To model the end-to-end delay, various entities of the MQTT-SN including handshake messages in MQTT-SN Pub/sub architecture over TCP, over UDP and then the queuing delay involved in server have been considered. We model the MQTT content and request server as a round-robin queue scheduler and also model a TOPIC ID based matching station that delivers the content on requested TOPIC ID. With this model we derive the end-to-end content delivery probability and content delivery delay estimate as functions of MQTT-SN system parameters such as content arrival rate, request arrival rate, possession time of content in server, possession time of request in server, number of content arrivals and number of requests arrivals. Both these service assurance parameters will give more insight into the number of content/request arrivals that can be supported for a given service assurance requirement. In addition these service assurance parameters will be of help to design the system more effectively. We carry out a detailed ns2 based simulation to show impacts of various system parameters on the network performances for various QoS services designed for MQTT-SN system.},   keywords={computer network reliability;delay estimation;energy conservation;Internet of Things;probability;quality of service;queueing theory;radiotelemetry;telecommunication scheduling;transport protocols;wireless sensor networks;NS2 based simulation;QoS service;content delivery delay estimation;end-to-end content delivery probability;TOPIC ID based matching station;round-robin queue scheduler;UDP;TCP;health care Internet of Things;message queue telemetry transport;wireless environment;energy efficient data transportation;loT MQTT-SN;end-to-end service assurance;Logic gates;Quality of service;Delays;Medical services;Round robin;Subscriptions;Transportation},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2015.7157991},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={19287-19294},   abstract={Magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) wireless power transfer (WPT) technology provides a novel solution to the tricky power-charging issue of densely connected sensor devices in the age of Internet of Things. Due to the cost and space constraints, the one-to-one MRC WPT is not suitable for charging the large number of sensor devices. The one-to-many MRC WPT requires less cost and space, but all receivers receive the power emitted from the transmitter disregarding the receivers' needs, which will lead to the accelerated aging even damage or malfunction of the receivers. In this paper, we propose a selective omnidirectional MRC WPT with multiple-receiver system. The power transmitted by an omnidirectional transmitter composed of three orthogonal circular coils will be received by any receiver located nearby. As the number of the transmitters reduces, the cost and space declines. Based on the band pass filter principle, the receivers selectively acquire the power at a designated frequency, which improves the energy efficiency and increase equipment service life. Moreover, for the proposed model, its magnetic field distribution of the simulation and physical experiments are carefully designed and performed, and their results are examined and analyzed in detail. They all confirm the capabilities of selective power transferring and the omnidirectional power transfer of the MRC WPT.},   keywords={ageing;band-pass filters;coils;energy conservation;inductive power transmission;magnetic resonance;radiofrequency power transmission;densely connected sensor devices;space constraints;selective omnidirectional MRC WPT;multiple-receiver system;omnidirectional transmitter;magnetic field distribution;selective omnidirectional magnetic resonant coupling wireless power transfer;tricky power-charging;Internet of Things;cost constraints;accelerated aging;orthogonal circular coils;cost reduction;band pass filter;energy efficiency;Receivers;Transmitters;Coils;Magnetic fields;Resonant frequency;Capacitors;Couplings;Magnetic resonant coupling (MRC);omnidirectional power transfer;selective power transfer;wireless power transfer (WPT)},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2809797},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

However, conventional model-driven CS frameworks suffer from limited compression ratio and reconstruction quality when dealing with physiological signals due to inaccurate models and the overlook of individual variability. In this paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10×, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.},   keywords={compressed sensing;electrocardiography;energy conservation;matrix algebra;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;physiological models;signal reconstruction;data-driven compressive sensing;energy-efficient wearable sensing;energy-efficient wireless sensors;long-term health monitoring;signal characteristics;personalized features;physiologic signals;cotraining approach;sensing matrix;isometry property;signal sparsity;ECG signals;compression ratio;reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio;Sensors;Dictionaries;Sparse matrices;Physiology;Training;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless communication;Data-driven compressive sensing;mobile healthcare;wearable sensing;Internet of things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952278},   ISSN={2379-190X},   month={March},}

Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties. At the end of the paper, we propose related research directions.},   keywords={cryptography;electronic commerce;transaction processing;Bitcoin consistency property;cryptocurrency;blockchain;distributed transaction ledger system;transaction log;ground truth;Online banking;Protocols;Cryptography;Mechanical factors;Medical services;Distributed databases;Bitcoin;Strong Consistency;Eventual Consistency;Blockchain;Distributed System},   doi={10.1109/PRDC.2017.39},   ISSN={2473-3105},   month={Jan},}

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.},   keywords={data analysis;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);wearable computers;on-node sensor data analytics;deep learning approach;wearable devices;inertial sensor;spectral domain preprocessing;smartphones;Internet-of-Things;Human Activity Recognition;HAR;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Time-frequency analysis;Spectrogram;Real-time systems;Pipelines;Performance evaluation;ActiveMiles;deep learning;Human Activity Recognition (HAR);Internet-of-Things (IoT);low-power devices;wearable;Human Activities;Humans;Machine Learning;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Neural Networks (Computer);Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2016.2633287},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Jan},}

The results show that the designed circuit has a good suitability with changing the value of the series inductor. Moreover, the actual center frequency of the transducer is lower than the tested resonance frequency (50.18 kHz), and it declined from 49.20 kHz to 48.93 kHz with increasing the total power from 8 W to 40 W.

Current literature and standards provide many protocols for data paths (data transfers) in these MPMC environments that can be used for IoT. However, data paths in MPMC environment must be easily configurable and manageable by end users in order for IoT to be more appealing to a broader user community. Multiple sensors with multiple applications from each manufacturer to control them would not be preferred by users.

In this paper, we propose an Efficient Query Tree (EQT) protocol to improve both the Query Tree (QT) protocol and the Collision Tree (CT) protocol.

In the EQT protocol, the timeslots structure, the query and responses between the reader and tags are carefully redesigned to allow tags to transmit fewer bits.

 title={Personalized wearable systems for real-time ECG classification and healthcare interoperability: Real-time ECG classification and FHIR interoperability}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={9-14},   abstract={Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.},   keywords={adaptive filters;bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;electronic health records;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;regression analysis;signal classification;signal denoising;ECG classification;wearable health monitoring devices;personalized health-care monitoring devices;signal processing;Savitzky-Golay filter;machine learning models;MIT-BIH Physionet;ECG kits biopotential measurements;kNN classifiers;neural net fitting models;SNOMED coding system;feature extraction method;ECG event observations;MITDB arrhythmia database;recursive least square adaptive filter;3-Lead ECG analog front-end;ECG waveforms;arrhythmia classification;heart rate variability analysis;electronic health records database;ECG monitoring;wearable biomedical devices;FHIR interoperability;healthcare interoperability;personalized wearable systems;Electrocardiography;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Databases;Adaptive filters;Real-time systems;Arrhythmia classification;Wearable IoT;Healthcare monitoring;ECG signal processing;Arrhythmia detection;Arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;ECG FHIR;SNOMED-CT FHIR;HAPI FHIR},   doi={10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

It involves a large quantity of smart devices for sensing health parameters including temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure and patient mobility. The medial sensing devices are connected with a somehow more powerful device like cell phone to exchange health parameters based data to central repositories at cloud. During data aggregation process, the collector nodes receive duplicate values that should be eliminated to reduce communication overheads. Due to sensitive nature of data, it must provide the secure data exchange to guard against various security attacks. To resolve these issues, we have presented a Secure De-duplicated Data Dissemination (S-DDD) scheme for healthcare IoT scenario using FoG servers at the edge of the network. To remove redundancy, we have also proposed a lightweight de-duplication mechanism that includes adaptive chunking algorithm (ACA) for identifying the cut-point between two windows.

 title={Leakage mitigation for low power microcontroller design in 40nm for Internet-of-Things (IoT)}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={126-129},   abstract={Modern systems for ubiquitous computing domains such as Internet-of-things (IoT), wearable computing etc. are characterized by low duty cycle, low operating and stand by power consumption requirements. The design of such systems is further constrained by increasing leakages due to technology scaling and/or increased data retention requirements. These conflicting requirements make leakage reduction of digital logic and SRAM a primary objective for efficient system realization. In this work, we discuss the effectiveness of advance leakage reduction techniques in 40nm (HYT technology) for SRAM and digital logic. For SRAM memory, adding error correction coding (ECC) to the memory subsystem can provide new trade-offs which will be advantageous for these low-duty cycle systems. We show that decreasing the data retention voltage while preventing errors using ECC will help decrease the leakage current by 45% (leakage power by 70% for SRAM). For the digital logic, test and simulation data shows that reverse body biasing (RBB) can reduce the logic leakage current by ~3x in the worst case process and temperature conditions. However, it should be carefully implemented as RBB causes increase in leakage current at nominal temperatures due to higher junction currents. Moreover, the asymmetric biasing where PMOS is biased by 0.7V and NMOS by 0.3V provides optimum results. RBB can also help reducing the switching energy at low frequency due to increased contribution of leakage to total energy compare to conventional technologies. We also show that increasing the gate length by 20% can help reduce the leakage current by 2x while there is minimal penalty on dynamic power and speed. Combining the asymmetric RBB application and increased gate-length can result in ~6x leakage reduction.},   keywords={error correction codes;Internet of Things;logic circuits;microcontrollers;power aware computing;SRAM chips;leakage mitigation;leakage reduction;low power microcontroller design;Internet-of-Things;IoT;ubiquitous computing;SRAM memory;digital logic;error correction coding;ECC;reverse body biasing;RBB;Decision support systems;Testing;Robustness;System analysis and design;Random access memory;Decoding},   doi={10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604684},   ISSN={1942-9401},   month={July},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={1471-1479},   abstract={Advances in multimedia technologies have led to the emergence of smart home applications. In fact, mobile multimedia technologies provide the infrastructure to adopt smart solutions and track inhabitants' activities. In-home activity recognition significantly enhances the performance of healthcaremonitoring and emergency-control applications for elderly and people with special needs. Developing and validating data models for such applications requires training sets that reflect a ground truth in the form of labeled or annotated data. With the accelerated development of Internet-of-Things applications, automated annotation processes have emerged understanding resident behavior in terms of activities. This paper presents a methodology for automatic data annotation by profiling sensing nodes.

 title={A PUF sensor: Securing physical measurements}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={648-653},   abstract={Sensors are important components in the Internet of Things (IoT) that encompass a wide spectrum of applications from healthcare to monitoring critical infrastructure. Securely gathering sensor measurements by adopting traditional cryptographic mechanisms is fraught with vulnerabilities emanating from the inability to safeguard secrets on edge devices, often in adversarial environments, where appropriate hardware protection logic and power consumption overheads are counterproductive to the desire to keep the devices low cost and long lasting. This paper continues recent efforts into investigating an alternative secure sensing approach with the potential to provide a solution for resource-restricted IoT devices. In particular, we investigate the possibility to exploit unreliability of a physical unclonable function (PUF) resulting from its sensitivity to variations in supply voltage conditions to guarantee the veracity of physical measurements from potentially any transducer capable of converting a physical phenomenon to a voltage signal. Therefore we present an approach that has the potential to realize a universal PUF sensor where the PUF itself acts as a sensor or is integrated with a sensor. Thus, for a PUF sensor, cryptographic processes and sensing are inseparable. Further, we rely on a dominant external condition-voltage-responsible for unreliability to secure sensing. We validate the feasibility of the proposed universal PUF sensor approach based on experimental data extracted from RO-PUFs (Ring Oscillator PUFs).},   keywords={computerised instrumentation;cryptography;Internet;Internet of Things;oscillators;reliability;security;sensors;transducers;PUF sensor;physical measurement security;Internet of Things;healthcare;critical infrastructure monitoring;cryptographic mechanism;hardware protection logic;power consumption;alternative secure sensing approach;resource-restricted IoT device;physical unclonable function;transducer;ring oscillator;RO;Sensors;Cryptography;Frequency division multiplexing;Internet of Things;Hardware;Transducers;PUF sensor;secure sensing;hardware security;physical unclonable function},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917639},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Although it provides all the details of both MAC and PHY layers of the protocol stack, the standard also explains specific methodologies to protect MAC packets through symmetric-key cryptography techniques under several security options. However, the orchestration of available security profiles and the management of key negotiation schemes is delegated to upper layers. In support of this feature, this work describes a standard compliant security framework aimed at proposing: (i) different kind of security architectures, (ii) an efficient mechanism for initializing a secure IEEE 802.15.4 domain, and (iii) a lightweight mechanism to negotiate link keys among devices. Experimental tests have been conducted to demonstrate the behavior of the proposed solution in real environments. Obtained results clearly show that the enabling of security features in constrained nodes requires additional computational efforts, which involve a not negligible growth of communication latencies. Such findings have to be carefully considered when designing and developing enhanced applications in future and secured Internet of Things (IoT) systems.},   keywords={access protocols;cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;IEEE 802.15.4 networks;short range low rate wireless communications;MAC layers;PHY layers;protocol stack;MAC packets;symmetric-key cryptography techniques;security profiles;key negotiation schemes;standard compliant security framework;security architectures;secure IEEE 802.15.4 domain;link keys;communication latencies;Internet of Things systems;Cryptography;Authentication;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Message systems;Lead;Random access memory;IoT;IEEE 802.15.4;security;key negotiation;experimental evaluation},   doi={10.1109/EMTC.2014.6996650},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

Healthcare industries will also get benefited due to reduced investments and management, automated services, better disease diagnosis/analysis, and minimum operations and maintenance. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), an element of IoT, enables several sensor nodes attached to a body that generates enormous volumes of healthcare data over the period of a patient. In life-critical pervasive healthcare applications, the data rates from the WBAN is unpredictable, requiring uneven resources in short time intervals to provide qualitative services. Cloud is abundant with pooled resources ready to meet such unpredictable workloads and rapidly deployable to handle massive amounts of data. This paper presents a mechanism that assesses the default resource allocation strategy regarding its response time in simulated IoT healthcare workloads which will raise irregular requirements of the resources from the cloud to handle massive amounts of data. Several experiments are conducted to study the optimal virtual machine allocation to meet the irregular resource requirements from cloud to suit to WBAN, the IoT scenario.

  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={5},   pages={1647-1662},   abstract={Modern wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices enable the monitoring of vital parameters such as heart or respiratory (RESP) rates, electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals within e-health applications. A common issue of wearable technology is that signal transmission is power-demanding and, as such, devices require frequent battery charges and this poses serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vitals. To ameliorate this, we advocate the use of lossy signal compression as a means to decrease the data size of the gathered biosignals and, in turn, boost the battery life of wearables and allow for fine-grained and long-term monitoring. Considering 1-D biosignals such as ECG, RESP, and PPG, which are often available from commercial wearable IoT devices, we provide a thorough review of existing biosignal compression algorithms. Besides, we present novel approaches based on online dictionaries, elucidating their operating principles and providing a quantitative assessment of compression, reconstruction and energy consumption performance of all schemes. As we quantify, the most efficient schemes allow reductions in the signal size of up to 100 times, which entail similar reductions in the energy demand, by still keeping the reconstruction error within 4% of the peak-to-peak signal amplitude. Finally, avenues for future research are discussed.},   keywords={body sensor networks;data compression;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wearable computers;health monitoring;vital parameters;ECG;photoplethysmographic signals;e-health applications;signal transmission;lossy signal compression;biosignal compression algorithms;wearable Internet of Things devices;Biomedical signal processing;energy efficiency;pattern recognition;signal compression;sparse autoencoders;wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2689164},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

The motivation of designing an efficient intelligent system that keeps track physical conditions, makes diagnosis based on the symptoms, and recommends appropriate treatments is the long-term objective in Health Informatics. In this talk, we will present our recent results of creating such the system using knowledge model and the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) technology. The system firstly requests the IoT device to send the physical conditions of a patient using specialized sensors namely LM35 (temperature measurement), Pluse Sensor (heartbeat) and ESP8266 (network connection). The collected personal symptoms are then integrated to a server for diagnosis of possible diseases such as viral fever, hypothermia, tachycardia and heart failure. This is done by a new technique called the intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system (IFRS), which in essence is a recommender system deployed in the intuitionistic fuzzy set for diagnosing of diseases under uncertain environments. We will present the theoretical basis of IFRS including: i) the formulation of single-criterion and multi-criteria IFRS accompanied with some essential properties; ii) a hybrid model between picture fuzzy clustering and IFRS called HIFCF; iii) intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) with intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM); and iv) linguistic similarity measure.

Under the background, human activity recognition (HAR) has drawn great attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a discriminant approach to recognize daily human activities recorded through accelerometer sensor. In the proposed approach, we first use S transform (ST) to extract features, and then introduce a supervised regularization-based robust subspace (SRRS) learning method to learn low-dimensional intrinsic feature representation from the original feature subspace. Particularly, ST has been described as a joint time-frequency representation (TFR), which is insensitive to noise. SRRS can learn more robust and discriminative features to reinforce the descriptions of samples while removing noise and redundancy.

In fact, research activities on healthcare support systems in AAL mainly focus on improving the quality of life for people in their own homes or supporting nurses and doctors in hospitals. This paper explores and applies the Internet of Things paradigm in the ALFs context. In particular, we present the design, the implementation, and the experimental evaluation of a system capable of supporting the daily activities of healthcare assistants that operate in ALFs for people with physical or cognitive disabilities. The solution combines wearable and mobile technologies to improve assistance requests and anomaly detection. With this healthcare support system, caregivers can be automatically alerted of potentially hazardous situations that happen to the inhabitants while these are out of sight. Furthermore, inhabitants can require assistance instantly and from any point of the facility. We evaluated the system in two ways.

GS1 EPCglobal has led the development of RFID standards from unique identifier, communication protocol to event repository. Recently, its scope starts to broaden with the new standard of EPC Information Service (EPCIS v1.1), while GS1 EPCglobal had focused on RFID middleware in the field of supply chain management (SCM). We believe that EPCIS can act as an event-based context repository for IoT. However, the challenges of scalability and flexibility should be taken into consideration against a large amount of heterogeneous data from a variety of sources. In this paper, we propose the novel open source platform complying with the EPCIS v1.1 specification called Oliot EPCIS, which can collect and share event data for a broad range of IoT applications. The main contribution of the paper is as follows. To resolve the challenges, we propose the scalable and flexible EPCIS architecture, the document-based model of EPCIS event and the new event called SensorEvent. We show that Oliot EPCIS generally outperforms two existing solutions through the comparative experiment. Also, with the healthcare case study, we show that Oliot EPCIS can capture and share sensor values requiring a very intensive data rate based on SensorEvent.},   keywords={information services;Internet of Things;radiofrequency identification;Oliot EPCIS;EPC information service;Internet of Things;radio frequency identification system;EPCglobal;RFID middleware;supply chain management;SCM;event-based context repository;IoT;EPCIS v1.1 specification;SensorEvent;Radiofrequency identification;Standards;Databases;XML;Scalability;Subscriptions;Context;RFID;EPCglobal Network;EPCIS;the Internet of Things;IoT},   doi={10.1109/RFID.2015.7113075},   ISSN={2374-0221},   month={April},}

To prevent such risks, statistics related to hypertension have to be monitored and analyzed in real time. Internet of Things (IoT) assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to monitor blood pressure and to diagnose the stage of hypertension in real time. In this paper, IoT-Fog based healthcare system is proposed for continuous monitoring and analysis of blood pressure statistics to predict hypertensive users. The proposed system initially identifies the stage of hypertension on the basis of user’s health parameters collected using IoT sensors at fog layer. After identifying the hypertensive stage, artificial neural network is used for predicting the risk level of hypertension attack in users at remote sites. The vital point of this paper is to continuously generate emergency alerts of blood pressure fluctuation from fog system to hypertensive users on their mobile phones. Finally, analysis results and compiled medical information of each user are stored on cloud storage for sharing with domain experts such as clinicians, doctors and personal caregivers. The temporal information generated from fog layer can be utilized for providing precautionary measures and suggestions well on time for patients’ wellness.

A fog assisted healthcare system can be used to diagnose users infected by Chikungunya virus in an initial state of their infection so that proper treatment can be given to them on time to enable fast recovery. In this paper, a fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system is designed to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of this virus. Initially, a decision tree is used to classify the category of user's infection depending on his/her health symptoms and diagnostic alerts are immediately generated on the user's mobile phone from fog layer. Furthermore, the state of Chikungunya virus outbreak is represented using temporal network analysis (TNA) on cloud layer using proximity data. Various outbreak metrics from TNA graph are calculated which indicate the probability to receive or transmit Chikungunya infection to human beings. Results depict that J48 decision tree classifier has higher accuracy and lower response time in determining the level of Chikungunya virus infection as compared to other classification algorithms. Moreover, alert generation based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},   keywords={cloud computing;decision trees;diseases;graph theory;health care;mobile computing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;healthcare framework;Aedes agypti;healthcare services;fog-cloud technology;fog assisted healthcare system;decision tree;real-time healthcare data;Chikungunya virus infection;Chikungunya virus outbreak;fog assisted cloud-based healthcare system;Cloud computing;Sensors;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Pain;Decision trees;Chikungunya;cloud computing (CC);decision tree;fog computing (FOC);temporal network analysis (TNA)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768407},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

 title={Adoption of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) as an opportunity for improving public health in Latin America}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Over the past 50 years, public health in Latin America has walked through significant changes on social and economic aspects. Since the 90's, governments from the region have performed different health reforms to improve equity, effectiveness and geographical coverage. Although, positive results have been achieved historically, strong and sustainable public health strategies are still needed to guarantee quality service. In that sense, integration of novel devices for monitoring and alerting patients about their physical health stands as a promising option for improving Latin American healthcare systems by upgrading facilities to be able to attend patients remotely, avoid care units overcrowding, guarantee real-time supervision, operational cost reduction, rapid patient attention, and lower investment on expansion of existing areas. Healthcare wearable technology acceptance and adoption barriers were investigated. It was found that most wearables are developed and promoted in developed countries with no headquarters in Latin America. This situation decreasing interest for its adoption by Latin American governments due to poor technical support, high prices, and few distribution channels. Four main barriers for wearable technology adoption were identified as: i) critical data management, security and privacy issues, ii) unreliable results accuracy, iii) unaffordable technology for low-income groups, and iv) lack of clear regulations. Based on the adoption barriers, healthcare wearable technology challenges were identified and presented. The main challenges found were: access to health service, training and distribution of human resources in health, inequalities in health, and financial schemes for health systems. It can be concluded that smart wearables in the healthcare sector could be considered as part of the solution to guarantee proper quality service and coverage in remote areas where no service is currently offered.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Latin America;geographical coverage;physical health stands;Latin American healthcare systems;Latin American governments;wearable technology adoption;healthcare wearable technology challenges;Internet of Medical Things;IoMT;healthcare wearable technology;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Government;Security;Public healthcare;Real-time systems;healthcare;wearable;IoMT;Latin-America;adoption;barriers;challenges},   doi={10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399181},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

These systems may offer several services of different criticality, necessitating safety-/mission-critical core components and non-critical peripheral components; in other words, they are complex, mixed-criticality System-of-Systems (SoS). To understand and design such systems, engineers must be facilitated with the appropriate modeling tools. In this work, we explore the application of model-based design, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), of IoT e-Health systems, emphasizing criticality requirements. We focus on the Remote Elderly Monitoring System (REMS) use case, combining IoT technologies with classic healthcare practices, to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. Requirements comprise a basic concept of a systematic model-driven methodology that enables the successful management of the criticalities in system design, implementation and deployment.

Presently, it is difficult to quickly forecast or prevent urgent health situations in real-time as health data are analyzed offline by a physician. Sensors are expected to be overloaded by demands of providing health data from IoT networks and smart environments. This paper proposes to resolve the problems by introducing an inference system so that life-threatening situations can be prevented in advance based on a short and long term health status prediction. This prediction is inferred from personal health information that is built by big data in Cloud.

 title={RoFi: Rotation-Aware WiFi Channel Feedback}, 
  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={5},   pages={1684-1695},   abstract={Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) provides high throughput for WiFi networks, but it also leads to high overhead due to channel state information (CSI) feedback. Based on experiment measurements, this paper shows that MIMO has different feedback requirements when the receiver is rotating compared with when the receiver is in other mobility scenarios. Experiments of four popular Android games show that device rotation accounts for around 50% of the running time for these games, which implies that rotation-awareness could improve WiFi efficiency significantly for these games. We propose rotation-aware WiFi (RoFi) channel feedback to eliminate unnecessary CSI feedback while maintaining high throughput. We show the failure of existing mobility-aware methods, including CSI similarity, time-of-flight (ToF), and compression noise, in distinguishing the mobility status of rotation and mobile. RoFi calculates power delay profile (PDP) similarity for rotation detection and performs feedback compression and rate selection accordingly. To deal with false rotation detection and status transition between rotation and static, RoFi uses the power of the strongest path, which is calculated from PDP, to further refine CSI feedback when necessary.

A portable embedded system for taking photoacoustic measurements on tissues to estimate glucose concentration is implemented using field programmable gate array (FPGA). The back-end architecture for high-speed data acquisition and de-noising of photoacoustic measurements operates at 274.823 MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA. The glucose measurement technique is verified in vitro on glucose solutions and in vivo on tissues, with photoacoustic signal amplitude varying linearly with sample glucose concentration. A kernel-based regression algorithm using multiple features of the photoacoustic signal is used to estimate glucose concentration from photoacoustic measurements. The calibration algorithm provides a superior performance over previous efforts with a mean absolute relative difference of 8.84% and Clarke Error Grid distribution of 92.86% and 7.14% over Zones A and B of the grid. A cloud computing platform for automated monitoring of blood glucose levels is proposed to enable individuals with diabetes to connect with doctors and caretakers.

Because the medical records in IoT-based hospital information system (HIS) are dispersedly obtained from distributed devices such as tablet computer, personal digital assistant, automated analyzer, and other medical devices, they are raw, simple, weak-content, and massive. Such medical records cannot be used for further analyzing and decision supporting due to that they are collected in a weak-semantic manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enrich IoT-based medical records by linking them with the knowledge in linked open data. A case study is conducted on a real-world IoT-based HIS system in association with our approach, the experimental results show that medical records in the local HIS system are significantly enriched and useful for healthcare analysis and decision making, and further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach for knowledge accessing.},   keywords={decision making;electronic health records;health care;Internet of Things;notebook computers;patient treatment;medical treatment;IoT-based facilities;raw medical records;medical advice;hospital information system;medical devices;medical record enrichment;distributed devices;linked open data;IoT-based HIS system;local HIS system;healthcare analysis;decision making;knowledge accessing;Medical diagnostic imaging;Resource description framework;Tools;Hospitals;Knowledge based systems;Data models;Internet of Thing;health care;knowledge graph;linked open data;semantic technology;data engineering;data sciences},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2810837},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={649-655},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoTs) is gaining increasing significance due to real-time communication and decision making capabilties of sensors integrated into everyday objects. IoTs are power and bandwidth-constrained with applications in smarthome, healthcare, transportation and industrial domains. Routing bears significant importance in IoTs where sensors acting as hosts deliver data to the gateways which in turn impacts power consumption. Thus there exists a need for modeling and analysis of routing in IoT networks towards predicting power consumption. In this work, we develop an analytical model of a naive flooding based routing protocol using Markov chains. In particular, we derive steady state transition probabilities of transmit and receive states using protocol execution traces and further utilize them towards predicting power consumption. Our approach to modeling is generic in that it can be applied to routing protocols across domains. Evaluation of the model shows that the predicted values for power consumption lie closer to the actual observations obtained using ns-2 simulation thus resulting in minimal mean square errors.},   keywords={Internet of Things;Markov processes;mean square error methods;routing protocols;IoT networks;Internet of Things;real-time communication;decision making capabilty;smarthome;healthcare;transportation;industrial domain;power consumption;routing analysis;routing modeling;flooding-based routing protocol;Markov chains;steady state transition probability;receive state;transmit state;protocol execution trace;ns-2 simulation;minimal mean square errors;Routing protocols;Routing;Computational modeling;Power demand;Markov processes;Analytical models},   doi={10.1109/CoCoNet.2015.7411258},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Leveraging the Potential of WSN for an Efficient Correction of Air Pollution Fine-Grained Simulations}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={One of the main concerns of smart cities is to improve public health which is mainly threatened by air pollution due to the massively increasing urbanization. The reduction of air pollution starts first with an efficient monitoring of air quality where the main aim is to generate accurate pollution maps in real time. Spatiotemporally fine-grained air pollution maps can be obtained using physical models which simulate the phenomenon of pollution dispersion. However, these simulations are less accurate than measurements that can be obtained using pollution sensors. Combining simulations and measurements, also known as data assimilation, provides better pollution estimations through the correction of the fine-grained simulations of physical models. The quality of data assimilation mainly depends on the number of measurements and their locations. A careful deployment of nodes is therefore necessary in order to get better pollution maps. In this paper, we tackle the deployment problem of pollution sensors and propose a new mixed integer programming model allowing to minimize the overall deployment cost of the network while achieving a required assimilation quality and ensuring the connectivity of the network. We then design a heuristic algorithm to solve efficiently the problem in polynomial time. We perform extensive simulations on a dataset of the Lyon city, France and show that our approach provides better air quality monitoring when compared to existing deployment methods that are designed without taking into account the outputs of physical models. We also show that in terms of connectivity, the communication range of sensor nodes might have a noteworthy impact on the quality of pollution estimation.},   keywords={Air pollution;Atmospheric modeling;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Sensor phenomena and characterization},   doi={10.1109/ICCCN.2018.8487343},   ISSN={1095-2055},   month={July},}

Although, the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services toward 5G.},   keywords={Big Data;data analysis;emotion recognition;Internet of Things;medical image processing;patient care;data analytics;big data-oriented wireless technologies;emotional care;emotion-aware connected healthcare system;image signals;seamless emotion-aware healthcare services;edge computing;interconnected devices;IoT devices;speech signals;healthcare big data;emotion detection module;Medical services;Emotion recognition;Big Data;5G mobile communication;Speech;Feature extraction;Wireless sensor networks;5G;big data;emotion recognition;emotion-aware healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);local binary pattern (LBP)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2772959},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

With limited computational power, BSN devices are often not able to provide strong security mechanisms to protect sensitive personal and health information, such as one's physiological data. Consequently, many new methods of securing Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been proposed recently. One effective solution is the Biometric Cryptosystem (BCS) approach. BCS exploits physiological and behavioral biometric traits, including face, iris, fingerprints, Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Photoplethysmography (PPG). In this paper, we propose a new BCS approach for securing wireless communications for wearable and implantable healthcare devices using gait signal energy variations and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework. By simultaneously extracting similar features from BSN sensors using our approach, binary keys can be generated on demand without user intervention. Through an extensive analysis on our BCS approach using a gait dataset, the results have shown that the binary keys generated using our approach have high entropy for all subjects. The keys can pass both NIST and Dieharder statistical tests with high efficiency. The experimental results also show the robustness of the proposed approach in terms of the similarity of intra-class keys and the discriminability of the inter-class keys.},   keywords={Sensors;Security;Wireless communication;Biometrics (access control);Wireless sensor networks;Servers;Communication system security;wearable security;gait biometrics;artificial neural network;data privacy;wireless communications;IoT security},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2018.2860780},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={},}

The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service.

Conventional D2D RA normally demands a sufficient level of channel knowledge to reach the optimal performance. But in vehicular communication environments, this would require tremendous signalling overhead and the acquired channel knowledge is easily outdated. Therefore, RA relying only on geographic information is more feasible. To this end, we propose a novel location-partition-based RA scheme. We first divide the cell coverage area and road into small zones, the geographic information of which is stored in a database. Satisfying the requirement that the interference generated by all V2V links to the reused cellular user (CU) is below a certain threshold, an interference matrix that reflects the interference from nodes in cell zones to road zones is established. Three types of power control methods are adopted to maximize the minimum achievable rate of the V2V links. A series of simulations are conducted to verify the performance of our proposed RA solution. The results show that our method can improve the minimum achievable rate compared with conventional location-based RA methods. The impact of different system parameters are also carefully analyzed.},   keywords={cellular radio;matrix algebra;mobility management (mobile radio);optimisation;power control;radio links;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless channels;geographic information;interference matrix;cell zones;road zones;minimum achievable rate;RA solution;location-partition-based resource allocation;resource allocation problem;vehicle-to-vehicle communications;optimal performance;vehicular communication environments;cell coverage area;cellular user;channel knowledge;location-based RA methods;D2D-supported vehicular communication networks;in-band device-to-device technology;V2V communications;location-partition-based RA scheme;Interference;Device-to-device communication;Roads;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Databases},   doi={10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417668},   ISSN={2577-2465},   month={June},}

This presentation discusses some methods used for anomaly detection and prognostics, including the monitoring and reasoning of parameters that are precursors to impending “failure”, such as shifts in performance parameters; and the modeling of stress and damage utilizing life cycle loads (e.g., usage, temperature, vibration, radiation).

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={The continued growth and popularity of IoT-based wearables coupled with wireless body area sensor network (BASN) communication architectures continues to gain widespread adoption for e-Health applications. Challenges facing the adoption of this vision require e- Health communication architectures for wearable IoT/BASNs to make effective use of bandwidth, energy stores for extended continuous transmission of physiological data, mitigation of computational burden when analyzing the data in the cloud at a global scale and, most importantly, ensuring the features of clinical significance in the biomedical signal are not compromised. In this paper, we present a novel physiologically-aware communication architecture to address these challenges for wearable IoT/BASNs for e-Health applications. The architecture works by extracting patient health state using local in-node pre-diagnosis (or pre-screening) to help guide the operation of the communication architecture in deciding when data should be transmitted, its type and format, and given quality. This latter property on preserving signal 'quality' is central to the architecture, which employs a feature-based diagnostic distortion measure to ensure retention of features of clinical significance during source coding in order to guarantee their reconstruction; a notion which carries greater emphasis for biomedical signals as opposed to ordinary multimedia signals. Simulation work of the architecture is presented in MATLAB using Electrocardiograph (ECG) signals from PhysioNet's ECG database, where it is demonstrated energy savings are realized by a factor of 30 with a reduction in biomedical data volume as high as 86% for tested cases while preserving clinical features.},   keywords={body area networks;body sensor networks;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;physiologically-aware architecture;biomedical signal;BASNs/IoT;IoTbased wearables;wireless body area sensor network communication architectures;BASN;e-Health applications;wearable IoT/BASNs;physiological data;clinical significance;patient health state;in-node pre-diagnosis;feature-based diagnostic distortion measure;biomedical data volume;clinical features;signal quality;multimedia signals;electrocardiograph signals;health communication architectures;physiologically-aware communication architecture;Distortion measurement;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Distortion;Biomedical monitoring},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422796},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

IoT embraces countless physical objects that have not been involved in the traditional Internet and enables their interaction and cooperation to provide a wide range of IoT applications. Many services in the IoT may require a comprehensive understanding and analysis of data collected through a large number of physical devices that challenges both personal information privacy and the development of IoT. Information privacy in IoT is a broad and complex concept as its understanding and perception differ among individuals and its enforcement requires efforts from both legislation as well as technologies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art principles of privacy laws, the architectures for IoT and the representative privacy enhancing technologies (PETs). We analyze how legal principles can be supported through a careful implementation of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) at various layers of a layered IoT architecture model to meet the privacy requirements of the individuals interacting with IoT systems. We demonstrate how privacy legislation maps to privacy principles which in turn drives the design of necessary privacy enhancing technologies to be employed in the IoT architecture stack.},   keywords={Privacy;Law;Data privacy;Internet of Things;Legislation;Guidelines;Internet of Things;privacy;privacy by design;privacy enhancing technologies;PET;privacy laws;GDPR.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2864168},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={666-671},   abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is emerging as one of the popular technologies influencing every aspect of human life. The IoT devices equipped with sensors are changing every domain of the world to become smarter. In particular, the majorly benifited service sectors are agriculture, industries, healthcare, control &amp;amp; automation, retail &amp;amp; logistics, and power &amp;amp; energy. The data generated in these areas is massive requiring bigger storage and stronger compute. On the other hand, the IoT devices are limited in processing and storage capabilities and can not store and process the sensed data locally. Hence, there is a dire need to integrate these devices with the external data sources for effective utilisation and assessment of the collected data. Several existing well-known message exchange protocols like Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are applicable in IoT communications. However, a thorough study is required to understand their impact and suitability in IoT scenario for the exchange of information between external data sources and IoT devices. In this paper, we designed and implemented an application layer framework to test and understand the behavior of these protocols and conducted the experiments on a realistic test bed using wired, wifi and 2/3/4G networks. The results revealed that MQTT and AMQP perform well on wired and wireless connections whereas CoAP performs consistently well and is less network dependent. On the lossy networks, CoAP generates low traffic as compared to MQTT and AMQP. The low memory footprint of MQTT and CoAP has made them a better choice over AMQP.},   keywords={Internet of Things;protocols;IoT devices;MQTT;AMQP;CoAP;external data sources;Message Queuing Telemetry Transport;Advanced Message Queuing Protocol;Constrained Application Protocol;IoT communications;data collection;message exchange protocols;Internet-of-Things messaging protocols;sensors;application layer framework;2/3/4G networks;Wi-Fi network;wired network;Protocols;Servers;Telemetry;Bandwidth;Monitoring;Cloud computing;Performance evaluation;IoT;Internet of Things;MQTT;AMQP;COAP;MQTT-SN;IoT Protocols;Application Layer Protocols;IoT applications},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.85},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={The recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have led to numerous emerging applications ranging from eHealthcare to industrial control, which often demand stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as low-latency and high system reliability. However, the ever-increasing number of connected devices in ultra-dense IoT networks and the dynamic traffic patterns increase the channel access delay and packet collision rate. In this regard, this paper proposes a sector-based device grouping scheme for fast and efficient channel access in IEEE 802.11ah based IoT networks such that the total number of the connected devices within each sector is dramatically reduced. In the proposed framework, the Access Point (AP) divides its coverage area into different sectors, and then each sector is further divided into distinct groups based on the number of devices and their location information available from the cloud-center. Subsequently, individual groups within a sector are assigned to specific Random Access Window (RAW) slots, and the devices within distinct groups in different sectors access the allocated RAW slots by employing a spatial orthogonal access mechanism. The performance of the proposed sectorized device grouping scheme has been analyzed in terms of system delay and network throughput. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance the network throughput while simultaneously decreasing the system delay as compared to the conventional Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and IEEE 802.11ah grouping scheme.},   keywords={Internet of Things;quality of service;radio networks;wireless LAN;packet collision rate;sector-based device grouping scheme;Access Point;IEEE 802.11ah;IoT networks;Random Access Window;IEEE 802.11ah grouping scheme;sectorized device grouping scheme;Delays;Throughput;Standards;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Media Access Protocol;MIMO communication},   doi={10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403521},   ISSN={2474-9133},   month={May},}

There are different data sources, like the traditional information held by public institutions (data about the traffic, the health care, etc.), the information generated by the citizens (using their smartphones, etc.), sensor systems on the city (camera networks, smart meters, etc.), in the context of the Internet of Things, etc. [1,4,10].},   keywords={data analysis;Internet of Things;public administration;smart cities;smart cities;e-government;information and communications technology;ICT;urban environments;software technologies;city environment;data generators;data analytic techniques;data sources;public institutions;sensor systems;Internet of things;Smart cities;Data analysis;Big data;Electronic government;Data mining},   doi={10.1109/ICEDEG.2016.7461463},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

 title={IoT based garbage management (Monitor and acknowledgment) system: A review}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={642-644},   abstract={Solid waste management is one of the primary problems that India faces irrespective of the case of developed or under development states. It is seen that most of the garbage's across the roadside are overloaded because the waste is not collected periodically. It creates unhygienic condition for the people and creates bad odor around the surroundings. This leads in spreading some deadly diseases and human illness. Most of the time wet and dry wastes are not separately collected so that proper processing like composting, recycling, incineration cannot be applied to different kinds of waste. This paper reviews system for garbage management and proposes a system which will take care of proper processing of garbage. The reviewed systems use ultrasonic sensor, infrared sensor [2] [7] for detecting the level of waste, Arduino UNO [6], microcontroller[3][11], Raspberry Pi2[7] as controlling boards. The proposed system uses ultrasonic sensors (as they are precise and have large range) to sense the level of garbage in the bin, flame sensor to detect the fire and moisture sensor to separate out wet and dry garbage. By using global system for mobile (GSM) the concerned persons (driver of garbage collecting vehicle as well as concerned authority) shall be informed through SMS. The officials shall monitor the status of waste bins through web page. As huge data is to be transmitted and processed fast Raspberry Pi3 is preferred as controlling board.},   keywords={cellular radio;diseases;environmental science computing;Internet of Things;microcontrollers;waste management;solid waste management;garbage management;ultrasonic sensor;flame sensor;moisture sensor;wet garbage;dry garbage;Raspberry Pi3;Arduino UNO;Raspberry Pi2;global system for mobile;Conferences;Monitoring;Solids;Waste management;Internet of Things;Wireless sensor networks;GSM;Internet of Things;Garbage Management;Dry Garbage;Wet Garbage},   doi={10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389250},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={11},   number={3},   pages={1888-1896},   abstract={Wireless technologies are pervasive to support ubiquitous healthcare applications. However, a critical issue of using wireless communications under a healthcare scenario rests at the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical sensors. In view of EMI on medical sensors, we propose a power control algorithm under a noncooperative game theoretic framework to schedule data transmission. Our objective is to ensure that the noncooperative game of power control can achieve a network-level objective-the optimal network capacity, although the wireless users are selfish and only interested in optimizing their own channel capacity. To obtain this objective, we show that our proposed noncooperative game is a potential game and propose the best-response-dynamics algorithm which can ensure that the game strategy of each user is induced to the optimal solution to the problem of network-level optimal capacity. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an enhancement of 8% of network performance than the existing algorithm against the variations of mobile hospital environments.},   keywords={channel capacity;electromagnetic interference;game theory;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;Internet of vehicles;e-health applications;electromagnetic interference;EMI;power control algorithm;noncooperative game theoretic framework;channel capacity;best-response-dynamics algorithm;network-level optimal capacity;mobile hospital;Games;Electromagnetic interference;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Hospitals;Mobile handsets;E-health;game theory;mobile hospital;Nash equilibrium;power control},   doi={10.1109/JSYST.2015.2441720},   ISSN={1932-8184},   month={Sept},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={10483-10496},   abstract={Although an Internet-of-Things-based smart home solution can provide an improved and better approach to healthcare management, yet its end user adoption is very low. With elderly people as the main target, these conservative users pose a serious challenge to the successful implementation of smart home healthcare services. The objective of this research was to develop and test a theoretical framework empirically for determining the core factors that can affect the elderly users' acceptance of smart home services for healthcare. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted with 254 elderly people aged 55 years and above across four Asian countries. Partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the effect of eight hypothesized predicting constructs. The user perceptions were measured on a conceptual level rather than the actual usage intention toward a specific service. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, expert advice, and perceived trust have a positive impact on the behavioral intention. The same association is negative for technology anxiety and perceived cost. Facilitating conditions and social influence do not have any effect on the behavioral intention. The model could explain 81.4% of the total variance in the dependent variable i.e., behavioral intention. Effort expectancy is the leading predictor of smart homes for healthcare acceptance among the elderly. Together with expert advice, perceived trust, and perceived cost, these four factors represent the key influence of the elderly peoples' acceptance behavior. This paper provides the groundwork to explore the process of the actual adoption of smart home services for healthcare by the elderly people with potential future research areas.},   keywords={geriatrics;health care;home automation;human factors;Internet of Things;medical information systems;behavioral intention;effort expectancy;smart homes;healthcare acceptance;expert advice;perceived trust;perceived cost;end user perspective;Internet-of-Things;smart home solution;healthcare management;end user adoption;conservative users;smart home healthcare services;user perceptions;Senior citizens;Smart homes;Medical services;Wearable sensors;Bibliographies;Sensor systems;Elderly;healthcare;smart homes},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2808472},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This study suggests a model to transmit and manage patients' health and medical information safely through authorization in the IoT environment. Different with preceding studies that focus on saving patient information on the servers or improving access control, the proposed model considers threats related to process of patent information with efficiency. This study introduces a model where patients authorize representatives, who will be authenticated by hospitals, to transfer information to other hospitals safely for security, practicality, and efficiency. Patient information security transferred among hospitals via a delegated user trusted by the patient using an access token issued by Token Repository. The advantage of this model is that it does not allow staff members or hospitals to collect information without patient's consent and thus reduces the risk of leaking patients' sensitive personal information to other places as the Token Repository saves nothing but the Access Token.},   keywords={authorisation;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patents;trusted computing;secure patient information transfer;delegated authorization;IoT equipment;health information safely;medical information safely;access control;patent information;hospitals;delegated user trusted;token repository;healthcare;Internet of Things;Security;Delegation;Medical Information;Healthcare},   doi={10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763434},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={12},   number={4},   pages={762-773},   abstract={Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is one of the main under-diagnosed sleep disorder. It is an aggravating factor for several serious cardiovascular diseases, including stroke. There is, however, a lack of medical devices for long-term ambulatory monitoring of OSA since current systems are rather bulky, expensive, intrusive, and cannot be used for long-term monitoring in ambulatory settings. In this paper, we propose a wearable, accurate, and energy efficient system for monitoring obstructive sleep apnea on a long-term basis. As an embedded system for Internet of Things, it reduces the gap between home health-care and professional supervision. Our approach is based on monitoring the patient using a single-channel electrocardiogram signal. We develop an efficient time-domain analysis to meet the stringent resources constraints of embedded systems to compute the sleep apnea score. Our system, for a publicly available database (PhysioNet Apnea-ECG), has a classification accuracy of up to 88.2% for our new online and patient-specific analysis, which takes the distinct profile of each patient into account. While accurate, our approach is also energy efficient and can achieve a battery lifetime of 46 days for continuous screening of OSA.},   keywords={body sensor networks;cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;embedded systems;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;sleep;time-domain analysis;medical wearable sensors;obstructive sleep apnea;OSA;sleep disorder;serious cardiovascular diseases;medical devices;long-term ambulatory monitoring;current systems;long-term monitoring;ambulatory settings;wearable energy efficient;long-term basis;embedded system;efficient time-domain analysis;sleep apnea score;PhysioNet Apnea-ECG;new online patient-specific analysis;online obstructive sleep apnea detection;accurate energy efficiency;time 46.0 d;Electrocardiography;Sleep apnea;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Batteries;Feature extraction;Wearable sensors;Long-term monitoring;Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA);Online detection;Real-time classification;Wearable sensor},   doi={10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2824659},   ISSN={1932-4545},   month={Aug},}

In such applications, some of the objects are attached with low-cost tags, which need to be monitored carefully. Hence, the object monitoring can be achieved by missing tag detection in the RFID system. However, unknown tags, whose IDs are not known by the reader in prior, may exist in the system to interfere the missing tag detection and reduce the time efficiency. In this paper, we propose a segmented bloom filter-based missing tag detection scheme called SBFMD, which consists of two phases, i.e., deactivation phase and detection phase. The idea behind the proposed SBFMD scheme is to eliminate the useless slots away from the bloom filter-based frame to improve the detection efficiency. We theoretically optimize the parameters of the proposed SBFMD scheme to maximize the efficiency with a required reliability. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed SBFMD scheme, the results of which validate its effectiveness.},   keywords={Protocols;Radiofrequency identification;Reliability;Servers;Interference;Estimation;Monitoring;Missing tag detection;RFID;segmented bloom filter;unknown tags},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872543},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={With the proliferation of cloud computing and the expected requirements of future Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G network scenarios, more efficient and scalable Data Centers (DCs) will be required, offering very large pools of computational resources and storage capacity cost-effectively. Looking at todays' commercial DCs, they tend to rely on well-defined leaf-spine Data Center Network (DCN) topologies that not only offer low latency and high bisectional bandwidth, but also enhanced reliability against multiple failures. However, routing and forwarding solutions in such DCNs are typically based on IP, thus suffering from its limited routing scalability. In this work, we quantitatively evaluate the benefits that the Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA) can bring into commercial DCNs. To this goal, we propose rule-based topological routing and forwarding policies tailored to the characteristics of publicly available Google's and Facebook's DCNs. These policies can be programmed in a RINA-enabled environment, enabling fast forwarding decisions in most scenarios with merely neighboring node information. Upon DCN failures, invalid forwarding rules are overwritten by exceptions. Numerical results show that the scalability of our proposal depends on the number of concurrent failures in the DCN rather than its size (e.g., number of nodes/links), dramatically reducing the total amount of routing and forwarding information to be stored at nodes. Furthermore, as routing information is only disseminated upon failures across the DCN, the associated communication cost of our proposals largely outperforms that of the traditional IP-based solutions.},   keywords={computer centres;Internet of Things;telecommunication network routing;communication cost;IP-based solutions;routing information;forwarding information;scalability;RINA-enabled environment;Facebook;Google;recursive internetwork architecture;reliability;DCN topologies;data center network;5G network;IoT;Internet of Things;cloud computing;proliferation;RINA-enabled large-scale datacenters;programmable topological routing policies;Routing;Topology;Google;Switches;Network topology;Scalability;TCPIP},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841627},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

So “offline” solutions based on this approach allows protecting privacy and provide good usability (“offline” means here partly or completely disconnected from the external operating signals and observations).

It included Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Mobility and Web Technology as emerging technologies. The focused research areas were on big data &amp;amp; analytics and image processing. The application domains were focused on social relevance such as environment monitoring, health care, safety and security, agriculture. And an additional open choice (others) was mentioned which gave an opportunity for students to explore other new technologies and research areas. Broadly the phases of conducting minor project are classified as team formation, problem identification/selection and project execution which in turn has several sub phases. In team formation students were given freedom to choose their partners with a team size of 4/5 within the same division. This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project. The Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) of minor project focused on the processes of software engineering and Semester End Exam (SEE) was focused on product/prototype development, technical skills and external recognition. The entire process of conducting minor project met the expected goals with five prizes in SRISHTI state level project exhibition 2016 and five projects accepted for E-poster presentation in international conference.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer science education;Internet of Things;project management;public domain software;software engineering;preferential theme matrix;minor project;computer science and engineering students;CSE students;Internet of Things;Cloud Computing;mobility technology;Web technology;big data;image processing;social relevance;environment monitoring;health care;safety;security;agriculture;cumulative grade point average;CGPA;project synopsis;project execution;requirement specifications;project design;project implementation;project testing;project deployment;E-poster presentation;SEE;semester end exam;software engineering;CIE;continuous internal evaluation;self learning;open source design tools;Cloud computing;IoT;Testing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Medical services;IoT;Smart City;Arduino;Raspberry Pi;Sensors;Web Technology;Cloud Services and Minor Project},   doi={10.1109/MITE.2016.049},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Situation awareness in AAL is to determine the environment smartness by perceiving information related to the surroundings and human behavioral changes. In AAL environment, there are plenty of ways to collect data about its inhabitants, such as through cameras, microphones, and other sensors. The collected data are complicated enough to go for an efficient processing in perceiving the situation. This paper gives an overview of the existing research results in multimodal data analysis in AAL environment to improve the living environment of the seniors, and it attempts to bring efficiency in complex event processing for real-time situational awareness. This paper thus considers multimodal sensing for detection of current situations as well as to predict future situations using decision-tree and association analysis algorithms. To illustrate the proposed approach, we consider elderly activity recognition in the AAL environment.},   keywords={assisted living;data analysis;geriatrics;health care;ubiquitous computing;living environment;real-time situational awareness;current situations;future situations;AAL environment;ambient assisted living;smart healthcare services;environment smartness;human behavioral changes;collected data;multimodal data analysis;Sensors;Senior citizens;Machine-to-machine communications;Monitoring;Ambient assisted living;Ambient assisted living;M2M communication;Internet of Things;multimodal sensing;activity recognition;smart healthcare},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2731363},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={414-418},   abstract={Most current studies of epileptic seizure detection disclose that "Despite the design of new anti-epileptic drugs, drug resistant epilepsy still lacks an ultimate solution" [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a timely chance for a more personalised approach to the monitoring and management of epilepsy. This is by integrating smart devices deployed at home and personal patient data into a unified monitoring system. However, because the data collected from monitoring epilepsy patients in hospital is constrained and the data semantic of the devices and patient are not unified, the integration of such data into meaningful information is difficult. A personalised approach has the potential to significantly improve the patients' daily lives whose seizures cannot be controlled by either drugs or surgery. This paper, provides an overview of a proposed personalised approach to not only promote this unification between patient data and devices but also to advocate that 'not one device fits all'. This way a personalised monitoring plan (PMP) for each individual epilepsy patient can be realised.},   keywords={drugs;Internet of Things;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;surgery;IoT approach;epileptic seizure detection;drug resistant epilepsy;smart devices;personal patient data;epilepsy patients;data semantic;surgery;personalised monitoring plan;antiepileptic drugs;personalised remote monitoring;Internet-of-things;seizures;Epilepsy;Monitoring;Smart devices;Biomedical monitoring;Hospitals;Ontologies;personalised remote monitoring;epilepsy;healthcare;internet of things;smart device;information management;wearable technology},   doi={10.1109/ISPAN-FCST-ISCC.2017.34},   ISSN={2375-527X},   month={June},}

The improving and opening of the health and medical data, as well as the wide use of the environment and the human body sensors, gives us the opportunity to do so. This paper proposes an "observant clinician and touchable patient" integrated architecture (OCTOPIA), which is for both clinician and patient and extendible. On the basis of integrated medical knowledge, human health and environmental data, OCTOPIA interacts with the patient in a heuristic way to analyze the patient's symptoms and likely diseases. Then, comprehensive data information will be presented to the clinician. In all key links, clinicians will have the opportunity to use their own experience to influence the final diagnosis. Broadly, OCTOPIA consists of five major components: data capture, symptom-disease graph, QA system, ranking likely diseases and visualization. This paper proposes an architecture integrating the environment and human body information, and presents the solutions of an interactive QA system for symptom, a multi-factor calculation model for disease and a visualization design. With the help of OCTOPIA, the patient's information and the state of the environment are more fully perceived, while clinician can make a more detailed diagnosis.},   keywords={data visualisation;diseases;graph theory;health care;medical diagnostic computing;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;medical data;human body sensors;observant clinician;touchable patient;OCTOPIA;integrated medical knowledge;human health;environmental data;comprehensive data information;data capture;symptom-disease graph;human body information;observant-clinician;touchable-patient integrated architecture;QA system;visualization design;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Ontologies;Tools;Data mining;Knowledge based systems;Symptom-Disease Graph;Interactive Query;Ambient Intelligence;Diagnosis;Integrated Architecture},   doi={10.1109/IIKI.2016.27},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

These wireless devices can be computers of all kinds, notebooks, netbooks, Smartphones and sensor nodes that evolve into real-world scenarios forming a “Real-World-Internet” in the future. In our work we focus on the Future Internet with small battery driven devices forming the “Internet of Things”. In recent networking research, testbeds gain more and more attention, especially in the context of Future Internet and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This development stems from the fact that simulations and even emulations are not considered sufficient for the deployment of new technologies as they often lack realism. Experimental research on testbeds is a promising alternative that can help to close the gap. The deployment of testbeds is challenging and user and operator requirements need to be considered carefully. Therefore, the goal is to design an architecture that allows operators of WSN testbeds to offer numerous users access to their testbeds in a standardized flexible way that matches these requirements. In this paper we first identify some of the requirements, then introduce the architecture and general concepts of our WISEBED approach and show how this architecture meets the requirements of both groups. We give an overview of existing WISEBED-compatible WSN testbeds that can be used for experimentation today.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-15},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging networking paradigm where smart devices generate, aggregate, and seamlessly exchange data over the predominantly wireless medium. The Internet, so far, has played a significant role in connecting the world, but still, IoT-based solutions are suffering from two primary challenges: 1) how to secure the sensors data and 2) how to provide efficient local and global communication among various heterogeneous devices. Recently, named data networking (NDN), a future Internet paradigm is proposed to improve and simplify such IoT communication issues. NDN allowed users to fetch data by names irrespective of the actual hosting entity connected through a host-specific IP address. NDN well suits the content-centric pattern of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications predominantly used in IoT. In this paper, we leverage the basic feats of NDN architecture for designing and verification of an NDN-based smart health IoT (NHealthIoT) system. NHealthIoT uses pure-NDN-based M2M communication for capturing and transmission of raw sensor data to the home server which can detect emergency healthcare events using Hidden Markov Model. Emergency events are notified to the cloud server using a novel context-aware adaptive forwarding (Cdf) strategy. Post emergency notifications, and user health information is periodically pulled by the cloud server and by other interested parties using NDN-based publish/subscribe paradigm. The cloud server carries out long-term decision making using probabilistic modeling for detecting the possibility of chronic diseases at the early stage. We extend the workflows intuitive formal approach model for verifying the correctness of NHealthIoT during the emergency. We evaluate the cdf strategy using ndnSIM. Moreover, to validate and to show the usability of NHealthIoT, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype testbed and evaluate it extensively. We also identify some research challenges of the NDN-IoT for researchers.},   keywords={Medical services;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Servers;Prototypes;Senior citizens;Wireless communication;Context-aware data forwarding strategy;healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);named data networking of things;NDN;NDNoT.},   doi={10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723843},   ISSN={2168-2216},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={372-379},   abstract={The recent advancements in technology and the availability of the Internet make it possible to connect various devices that can communicate with each other and share data. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new concept that allows users to connect various sensors and smart devices to collect real-time data from the environment. However, it has been observed that a comprehensive platform is still missing in the e-Health and m-Health architectures to use smartphone sensors to sense and transmit important data related to a patient's health. In this paper, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we critically evaluate the existing literature, which discusses the effective ways to deploy IoT in the field of medical and smart health care. Secondly, we propose a new semantic model for patients' e-Health. The proposed model named as `k-Healthcare' makes use of 4 layers; the sensor layer, the network layer, the Internet layer and the services layer. All layers cooperate with each other effectively and efficiently to provide a platform for accessing patients' health data using smart phones.},   keywords={Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;smart phones;Internet of things;medical care;smart health care;IoT;real-time data;m-Health architectures;smartphone sensors;patient e-Health;k-healthcare;Medical services;Radiofrequency identification;Intelligent sensors;Internet;Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;IoT;e-Health;m-Health;RFID;Healthcare;Body sensor;Cloud storage;Remote monitoring},   doi={10.1109/INTELSE.2016.7475151},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

  year={2016},   volume={34},   number={5},   pages={1645-1662},   abstract={Fiber-wireless sensor networks (Fi-WSNs) composed of a hybrid fiber-wireless (FiWi) network enhanced with sensors will play a key role in supporting machine-to-machine (M2M) communications to enable a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, of which smart grids represent an important real-world example. This paper explores opportunities of designing an energy-efficient Fi-WSN based on EPON/10G-EPON, WLAN, wireless sensors, and passive fiber optic sensors as a shared communications infrastructure for broadband services and smart grids. A novel energy conservation scheme for sensor enhanced FiWi networks (ECO-SFiWi) is proposed to reduce the overall energy consumption. ECO-SFiWi maximizes energy efficiency by leveraging TDMA to schedule power-saving modes of EPON's optical network units, wireless stations, and wireless sensors and incorporate them into EPON's bandwidth allocation algorithm. To study the performance, a comprehensive energy saving model and a delay analysis of both FiWi traffic and sensor data based on M/G/1 queue modeling are presented. FPGA-based hardware emulation and demonstration are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Results provide deep insights into the tradeoff between energy savings and frame delays. Noticeably, ECO-SFiWi achieves significant amounts of energy saving, while maintaining low delay for FiWi traffic and sensor data under typical deployment scenarios.},   keywords={bandwidth allocation;broadband networks;energy conservation;energy consumption;fibre optic sensors;field programmable gate arrays;optical fibre networks;queueing theory;telecommunication power management;time division multiple access;wireless sensor networks;wireless station;EPON bandwidth allocation algorithm;energy saving model;delay analysis;FiWi traffic;M-G-1 queue modeling;FPGA-based hardware emulation;frame delay;EPON optical network unit;power-saving mode scheduling;TDMA;overall energy consumption reduction;broadband service;shared communication infrastructure;passive fiber optic sensor;wireless sensor;WLAN;EPON-10G-EPON;smart grid;IoT applications;Internet of Things applications;M2M communication;machine-to-machine communication;hybrid FiWi network;hybrid fiber-wireless network;fiber-wireless sensor network;energy-efficient Fi-WSN design;ECO-SFiWi energy efficiency maximization;sensor enhanced FiWi network;energy conservation scheme hardware emulation;energy conservation scheme analysis;energy conservation scheme design;Smart grids;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Optical network units;Passive optical networks;Wireless LAN;Optical fiber sensors;Energy efficiency;Fiber-Wireless (FiWi);Fieldprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs);sensors;smart grids;TDMA.;Energy efficiency;Fiber-Wireless (FiWi);Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);sensors;smart grids;TDMA},   doi={10.1109/JSAC.2016.2545380},   ISSN={0733-8716},   month={May},}

The pervasive nature of noise in the modern environment makes this an ideal factor for monitoring unobtrusively in the Smart Environment. Noise monitoring using distributed Raspberry Pi computers has already been established in several other studies, but rarely in a domestic setting. The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential for using off-the-shelf, low-cost components to develop a wireless sensor network for unobtrusive sound monitoring in a domestic environment, where anomalous readings trigger alerts. The study investigates the transferability of the prototype into assisted living to enable seniors to live independently in their own homes.

These objects can be humans, animals, or simple artefacts. Many important and critical applications such as surveillance or health care require some form of (human) activity recognition. Existing languages can be used to describe models of activities, but they are difficult to master by non computer scientists (ex: doctors). In this paper, we present a new language dedicated to end users, to describe their activities. We call it ADeL (Activity Description Language). This language is intended to be part of a complete recognition system. Such a system has to be real time, reactive, correct, and dependable. We choose the synchronous approach because it respects these characteristics, it ensures determinism and safe parallel composition, and it allows verification of systems using model-checking. Relying on the synchronous approach, we supply our language with two complementary formal semantics and we provide it with two formats: textual and graphical.

The most important agricultural process, which should be controlled and adapted for better growth of the plants is irrigation. Due to changing climate and degraded quality of soil, farmers are getting less productions in farms. Currently, cultivation consumes around 70 percent of the fresh water. This percentage should be decreased by performing efficient water management. Agriculture production decreases due to intrusion of birds, animals, etc. on farmland. It can be controlled by securing the farmland with sensors, buzzers and scarecrow (automated toy). The proposed solution is to collect, analyse and monitor the real time sensor data like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, PIR (Passive Infrared Sensor), etc. with the help of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in every 10 seconds from soil and environment. Such that irrigation and crop security operations will be monitored automatically based on pre-calculated threshold values. This venture applies the water effectively, in the right place, at the right time and in the proper sum.

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based privacy-aware offloading scheme to help healthcare IoT devices protect both the user location privacy and the usage pattern privacy. More specifically, this scheme enables a healthcare IoT device to choose the offloading rate that improves the computation performance, protects user privacy and saves the energy of the IoT device without being aware of the privacy leakage, IoT energy consumption and edge computation model. This scheme uses transfer learning to reduce the random exploration at the initial learning process and applies a Dyna architecture that provides simulated offloading experiences to accelerate the learning process. A post-decision state learning method uses the known channel state model to further improve the offloading performance. We provide the performance bound of this scheme regarding the privacy level, the energy consumption and the computation latency for three typical healthcare IoT offloading scenarios. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the computation latency, save the energy consumption, and improve the privacy level of the healthcare IoT device compared with the benchmark scheme.},   keywords={Medical services;Privacy;Sensors;Energy consumption;Energy harvesting;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Internet of Things;healthcare systems;mobile edge offloading;energy harvesting;privacy;reinforcement learning.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2875926},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

And then, most authors of articles related to future mobile communication made no mention of business schemes such as who deploys network infrastructure or who provides service content. However, the histories of existing mobile communication markets may show applications that are different from the ones written in the above articles and new business schemes that are different from existing ones. In this article, I analyze the dominant non-voice applications of the existing mobile communication systems including paging services and identify the primary factors that made them dominant. I also analyze the business models of the network carriers. This analysis leads me to forecast that the next-generation of dominant mobile communication applications will be developed on the basis of a balance between the freedom of participants and suspicion, and the business models will become more liberal.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={407-413},   abstract={As more and more devices connect to Internet of Things, unbounded streams of data will be generated, which have to be processed "on the fly" in order to trigger automated actions and deliver real-time services. Spark Streaming is a popular realtime stream processing framework. To make efficient use of Spark Streaming and achieve stable stream processing, it requires a careful interplay between different parameter configurations. Mistakes may lead to significant resource overprovisioning and bad performance. To alleviate such issues, this paper develops an executable and configurable model named SSP (stands for Spark Streaming Processing) to model and simulate Spark Streaming. SSP is written in ABS, which is a formal, executable, and object-oriented language for modeling distributed systems by means of concurrent object groups. SSP allows users to rapidly evaluate and compare different parameter configurations without deploying their applications on a cluster/cloud. The simulation results show that SSP is able to mimic Spark Streaming in different scenarios.},   keywords={Internet of Things;object-oriented languages;stable stream processing;executable model;configurable model;SSP;Spark Streaming Processing;parameter configurations;Internet of Things;Sparks;Object oriented modeling;Data models;Predictive models;Informatics;Simulation;Real-time systems;Spark Streaming;modeling;simulation},   doi={10.1109/AINA.2018.00068},   ISSN={2332-5658},   month={May},}

  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={5},   pages={1272-1283},   abstract={Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are electronic devices implanted within human body for diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes. It is imperative to guarantee that IMDs are completely secured since the patient's life is closely bound to the robustness and effectiveness of IMDs. Intuitively, we have to ensure that only the authorized medical personnel and IMD programmer can access the IMD. However, in recent years, several attacks have been reported which can successfully compromise a number of IMD products, e.g., stealing the sensitive health data and issuing fake commands. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed and well-recognized security standards and the protection of IMD is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on IMD security, with a focus on the access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, we first reviewed the security incidents, IMD threat model and the development of regulations for IMD security. Next, we classified existing IMD access control schemes based on architecture, type of keys used, access control channel, and logic. We also analyzed how different access control models can be adopted to secure IMD. Besides, we particularly discussed the viability of online authentication and low/zero power authentication in the IMD context.},   keywords={authorisation;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;message authentication;prosthetics;authorized medical personnel;IMD security;IMD threat model;IMD access control schemes;implantable medical devices;electronic devices;online authentication;zero power authentication;Access control;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Authentication;US Government agencies;Access control;implantable medical devices (IMDs);survey},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2708042},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Servers;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Hospitals;Delays;Cloud computing;privacy;blindness;wireless body area networks (WBANs);Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2739141},   ISSN={1089-7798},   month={Nov},}

Due to the importance of the target applications in the daily life, BASNs are a promising candidate for being included into the future Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, the data gathering of the human activity may help customizing the services provided by the IoT and thus dramatically improve the IoT user experience. Magnetic Induction (MI) based communication is known in the context of wireless power transfer (WPT), near-field communication (NFC), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in challenging environments. In this approach, induction coils are utilized as antennas in the sensor nodes. Distributed beamforming is a well-known technique, that has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Here, the basic idea is to align the phases of signals from different sensor nodes in such a way that a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with favorable properties is created. For example, this strategy may lead to an improved directionality of the transmitted signals and increase the achievable data rate. In this work, we analyze the potential of the distributed beamforming based MI-BASNs. We observe a significant increase of the achievable data rate for the proposed distributed beamforming compared to our selected baseline scheme.},   keywords={array signal processing;body area networks;body sensor networks;electromagnetic induction;health care;Internet of Things;MIMO communication;near-field communication;radiofrequency power transmission;distributed beamforming based MI-BASN;MIMO system;virtual multiple input multiple output system;WSN;NFC;near-field communication;WPT;wireless power transfer;MI based communication;IoT user experience improvement;human activity data gathering;Internet of Things;healthcare;magnetic induction based body area sensor network},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841737},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

This nonlinear problem has been a focus of significant attention over the past two centuries and the progress follows closely with the advances in instrumentation as well as applied mathematics, geometry, statistics, and signal processing. The Internet-of-Things (IoT), with massive deployment of wireless tagged things, has renewed the interest and activity in finding novel, expert, and accurate indoor self-localization methods, where a particular emphasis is on distributed approaches. This paper is dedicated to reviewing a notable alternative to the nonlinear localization problem, i.e., a linear-convex method, based on Khan et al.'s work. This linear solution utilizes relatively unknown geometric concepts in the context of localization problems, i.e., the barycentric coordinates and the Cayley-Menger determinants. Specifically, in an m-dimensional Euclidean space, a set of m+1 anchors, objects with known locations, is sufficient (and necessary) to localize an arbitrary collection of objects with unknown locations-hereinafter, referred to as sensors, with a linear-iterative algorithm. To ease the presentation, we discuss the solution under a structural convexity condition, namely, the sensors lie inside the convex hull of at least m+1 anchors. Although rigorous results are included, several remarks and discussion throughout this paper provide the intuition behind the solution and are primarily aimed toward researchers and practitioners interested in learning about this challenging field of research.

However, the massive growth in wireless devices and the push for interconnecting these devices to form an Internet of Things (IoT) can be challenging for WBANs; hence robust communication is necessary through careful medium access arbitration. In this paper, we propose a new protocol to enable WBAN operation within an IoT. Basically, we leverage the emerging Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) and promote the integration of a BLE transceiver and a Cognitive Radio module (CR) within the WBAN coordinator. Accordingly, a BLE informs WBANs through announcements about the frequency channels that are being used in their vicinity. To mitigate interference, the superframe's active period is extended to involve not only a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, but also a Flexible Channel Selection (FCS) and a Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC). With the help of CR, an IMC is selected for a WBAN and each interfering sensor will be allocated a time-slot within the (FBTDMA) frame to retransmit using such IMC.},   keywords={body area networks;cognitive radio;interference;Internet of Things;time division multiple access;IoT-enabled channel selection approach;WBAN;wireless body area networks;Internet of Things;Bluetooth low energy technology;BLE transceiver;cognitive radio module;flexible channel selection;FCS;flexible backup TDMA frame;interference mitigation channel;IMC;Reactive power;Sensors;Reliability;IoT;Channel allocation;WBAN interference mitigation;Bluetooth low energy;Cognitive radio},   doi={10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986554},   ISSN={2376-6506},   month={June},}

 title={A New Deep-Q-Learning-Based Transmission Scheduling Mechanism for the Cognitive Internet of Things}, 
  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={4},   pages={2375-2385},   abstract={Cognitive networks (CNs) are one of the key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT), where CNs will play an important role in the future Internet in several application scenarios, such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. However, the current low packet transmission efficiency of IoT faces a problem of the crowded spectrum for the rapidly increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, the IoT that uses the advantages of cognitive technology, namely the cognitive radio-based IoT (CIoT), is a promising solution for IoT applications. A major challenge in CIoT is the packet transmission efficiency using CNs. Therefore, a new Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism using deep learning for the CIoT is proposed to solve the problem of how to achieve the appropriate strategy to transmit packets of different buffers through multiple channels to maximize the system throughput. A Markov decision process-based model is formulated to describe the state transformation of the system. A relay is used to transmit packets to the sink for the other nodes. To maximize the system utility in different system states, the reinforcement learning method, i.e., the Q learning algorithm, is introduced to help the relay to find the optimal strategy. In addition, the stacked auto-encoders deep learning model is used to establish the mapping between the state and the action to accelerate the solution of the problem. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new action selection method can converge after a certain number of iterations. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can better transmit packets with less power consumption and packet loss.},   keywords={cognitive radio;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);scheduling;cognitive networks;crowded spectrum;wireless applications;cognitive technology;cognitive radio-based IoT;CIoT;IoT applications;system throughput;Markov decision process-based model;system utility;reinforcement learning method;Q learning algorithm;stacked auto-encoders deep learning model;power consumption;packet loss;cognitive Internet of Things;CN;deep-Q-learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism;packet transmission efficiency;Internet of Things;Relays;Wireless sensor networks;Throughput;Bit error rate;Scheduling;Machine learning;Cognitive networks (CNs);deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);Markov decision process;Q learning (QL)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2759728},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

There are many technologies used for IoT such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LTE-Advanced. IoT for health sector in Indonesia is used to improve health services based on telemedicine services roadmap by Indonesian Ministry of Health. This services include teleECG, teleRadiology and teleUSG which utilize mobile technology. In Indonesia, there is a tendency that IoT will be implemented on a large scale. Meanwhile, Indonesia is expected to experience deficiency of 500 MHz mobile spectrum in 2020. Therefore, the calculation of spectrum for telemedicine services is urgently needed. This paper aims to calculate the spectrum that is required for health sector in Indonesia by using mobile technology especially LTE. We use the method of general LTE planning equation. The result is the requirements of spectrum for telemedicine services will be growing 14.44% until 2025. On 2025, telemedicine services are predicted to use 165,47 kHz. Regardless of the spectrum needed by telemedicine services is only in the order of kHz, it should be considered since it will enlarge spectrum deficiency in Indonesia. The government of Indonesia should prepare about strategic spectrum management to anticipate the massive growing of IoT application, such as a roadmap of IoT development and a regulation of specific frequency in the nearest future.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;telecommunication network management;spectrum requirement;IoT health sector;Indonesia;Internet of Things;health services;telemedicine services roadmap;Indonesian Ministry of Health;mobile technology;general LTE planning equation;telemedicine services;Telemedicine;Mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;Mathematical model;Broadband communication;Medical diagnostic imaging;IoT;health;Spectrum needs;telemedicine services;Indonesia;LTE},   doi={10.1109/ISTT.2016.7918096},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources.

  year={2015},   volume={23},   number={4},   pages={1135-1148},   abstract={We focus on the problem of efficient communications over access networks with asymmetric bandwidth and capability. We propose a resource-constrained asymmetric redundancy elimination algorithm (RCARE) to leverage downlink bandwidth and receiver capability to accelerate the uplink data transfer. RCARE can be deployed on a client or a proxy. Different from existing asymmetric algorithms, RCARE uses a flexible matching mechanism to identify redundant data and allocates a small sender cache to absorb the high downlink traffic overhead. Compared to existing redundancy elimination algorithms, RCARE provides a scalable sender cache that is adaptive based on resource and performance. We evaluate RCARE with real traffic traces collected from multiple servers and a campus gateway. The trace-driven simulation results indicate that RCARE achieves higher goodput gains and reduces downlink traffic compared to existing asymmetric communication algorithms. We design an adaptation algorithm for resource-constrained senders sending multiple data streams. Our algorithm takes samples from data streams and predicts how to invest cache size on individual data streams to achieve maximal uplink goodput gain. The adaptation algorithm improves the goodput gain by up to 87% compared to the baseline. In first 10% of data streams (sorted by the optimal goodput gains), RCARE achieves up to 42% goodput gain on average.},   keywords={computer networks;transport protocols;resource-constrained asymmetric redundancy elimination algorithm;communications over access networks;asymmetric bandwidth;RCARE;downlink bandwidth;receiver capability;uplink data transfer;flexible matching mechanism;resource-constrained senders;Receivers;Redundancy;Uplink;Heuristic algorithms;Downlink;Bandwidth;Algorithm design and analysis;Asymmetric communications;Internet of Things;network protocols;performance evaluation},   doi={10.1109/TNET.2014.2322889},   ISSN={1063-6692},   month={Aug},}

The IoT refers to the physical devices that are interconnected with each other. In the case of Health care services, the medical gadgets like thermometer, ECG, weight scale, etc., are interrelated using certain sensors. It can be used to sense, detect and predict the health condition of the patient. The sensors or actuators attached to the patient will spot out the changes taking place in their body. These details are collected and sent to the databases after undergoing certain stages of processing. The information which gets stored in the database or end systems can be retrieved and utilized whenever it is necessary. Based on those particulars, diagnosis can be performed in an efficient way and as a result the Doctor will be able to provide the appropriate treatment. This method of transformation of the health care services using the Internet of Things can be extended to the next level by implementing it in the rural areas where even the basic medical facilities are denied. In this paper, the details about IoT, its perspectives, its role in the Health Care services, its way of implementation, applications and the challenges faced are explored in a depth.

With the abundance in the internet connectivity, distributed denial of service attack incidents is many folded in the recent past. The constrained nature of IoT devices makes them the easy target for the attackers. Further, the trade-off between quantitative factors like size, space and response time with a qualitative property like security mechanism, on a manufacturer's point of view, always prefers the quantitative properties and the security mechanisms in most of the IoT-enabled smart devices are minimal. Considering such a scenario, we propose a model to secure the IoT network like a smart home using a secure gateway router. Further, we propose the risk transfer mechanism based on economic incentive based agreement. It can be the most feasible solution in a case if the owner of the network is not always able to ensure the security of the whole network.

The ICN approach consists of the retrieval of content by (unique) names, regardless of origin server location (i.e., IP address), application, and distribution channel, thus enabling in-network caching/replication and content-based security. The expected benefits in terms of improved data dissemination efficiency and robustness in challenging communication scenarios indicate the high potential of ICN as an innovative networking paradigm in the IoT domain. IoT is a challenging environment, mainly due to the high number of heterogeneous and potentially constrained networked devices, and unique and heavy traffic patterns. The application of ICN principles in such a context opens new opportunities, while requiring careful design choices.

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare is the key to handle the challenges of the growing population around the world. A variety of u-healthcare systems have been developed using various short-range technologies and proprietary protocols which include Zigbee and bluetooth. With all these protocols, interoperability of smart devices remains a challenge. 6LoWPAN as an open standard has recently evolved to provide one common platform on the top of IEEE802.15.4 for low power devices and to mitigate this interoperability problem. In this paper, we present a novel 6LoWPAN based communication platform for next-generation u-healthcare system. The system integrates three nodes forwarding data to an edge router in order to provide real-time monitoring of the patient's ECG, temperature, and acceleration. A PC connected to the edge router acts as a two-directional Gateway between 6LoWPAN and internet. A new gateway application, listening to UDP packets from the 6LoWPAN nodes via the edge router along with any TCP client request from the internet, is developed. Thereby, any remote PC can connect to the gateway using TCP/IP by just connecting to the IP address and dedicated port of the gateway, fostering then ubiquity as well as Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the user can send instructions to any node where the application running on the gateway translates the command to a particular node. In our case, we used a Labview program to provide this connectivity. The whole system was tested successfully for different ECG rates using an ECG simulator. The received waveforms were found identical to those shown by a high-resolution scope wired to the ECG signals.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;transport protocols;ubiquitous computing;indoor 6LoWPAN based platform;real-time healthcare monitoring;ubiquitous healthcare;u-healthcare systems;bluetooth;Zigbee;smart devices;IEEE802.15.4;interoperability problem;communication platform;next generation u-healthcare system;edge router;real-time monitoring;gateway application;TCP client;remote PC;TCP/IP;Internet of Things;Labview program;Electrocardiography;Logic gates;Medical services;Real-time systems;Protocols;Accelerometers;Temperature sensors;6LoWPAN;U-Healthcare;WSN;WBAN;IEEE802.15.4},   doi={10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548958},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

This paper proposes a hybrid security model for securing the diagnostic text data in medical images. The proposed model is developed through integrating either 2-D discrete wavelet transform 1 level (2D-DWT-1L) or 2-D discrete wavelet transform 2 level (2D-DWT-2L) steganography technique with a proposed hybrid encryption scheme. The proposed hybrid encryption schema is built using a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard, and Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman algorithms. The proposed model starts by encrypting the secret data; then it hides the result in a cover image using 2D-DWT-1L or 2D-DWT-2L. Both color and gray-scale images are used as cover images to conceal different text sizes. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated based on six statistical parameters; the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), structural similarity (SSIM), structural content (SC), and correlation. The PSNR values were relatively varied from 50.59 to 57.44 in case of color images and from 50.52 to 56.09 with the gray scale images.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={657-661},   abstract={Due to hectic life schedule, people usually tends to forget to take their medicine on time due to forgetfulness. In most rural parts of India most of the people are unable to follow the doctor's prescription, which causes over dosage or wrong dosage due to misunderstanding of doctor's direction. It may cause negative consequences for patients. Sometimes it results to severe impact on their health. This paper presents the design and implementation of “eMedicare” for those who take medications without continuous professional supervision. Electronic dispensing systems are eHealth drug storage devices that electronically dispense medications in a programmed fashion and track medication use. eMedicare acts as watchdog for medication usage. eMedicare can track the missed medications doses. It notifies the patients through beating an alarm, or through a phone call or updating data on the server. Live data is updated in the server for each dose at the scheduled time with help of Internet of Things (IoT)[3]. Sometimes even after the alarm, if the patients did not take any medicines then it will alert the care takers/ nursing staff through sending messages to server or making phone calls. Caretaker can access the details anywhere using mHealth.},   keywords={drugs;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient care;eMedicare;mHealth solution;patient medication guidance;patient medication assistance;electronic dispensing systems;eHealth drug storage devices;phone call;Internet-of-Things;IoT;patient care;nursing;Servers;DC motors;Medical services;Liquid crystal displays;Schedules;Microcontrollers;Mobile communication;eMedicare;eHealth;mHealth;IoT;Medication},   doi={10.1109/SCOPES.2016.7955523},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

It depends strongly on the doctors' long-term experience as well as on their different inferences. Being subjective and based on long-term experience, pulse detection methods are difficult to standardize. Kim pulse diagnosis (KPD), established by Wei Jin, is an efficient method validated by both traditional Chinese medicine and in recent years also by western medicine. The key step to automatic implementation of KPD, using signal processing and analysis, is the developed KPD signal acquisition device. However, the raw wrist pulse signal acquired from KPD device includes a significant amount of noise. This paper proposes several preprocessing algorithms for pulse diagnosis, that includes wavelet transform and Gaussian filter to remove noise and the iterative sliding window (ISW) algorithm to remove the baseline wander and split the continuous signal into single periods. Experimental results show, that the algorithm for baseline wander removal is efficient and that the segmented signal matches the signal described in KPD.},   keywords={filtering theory;Gaussian processes;health care;iterative methods;medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;signal denoising;wavelet transforms;traditional Chinese medicine;wrist pulse diagnosis;KPD signal acquisition device;wavelet transform;Gaussian filter;noise removal;iterative sliding window;segmented signal;continuous signal;window algorithm;raw wrist pulse signal;signal processing;western medicine;kim pulse diagnosis;pulse detection methods;health status;KPD based signal preprocessing algorithm;Wrist;Algorithm design and analysis;Wavelet transforms;Adaptive filters;Signal processing algorithms;Filtering algorithms;preprocessing algorithm;Kim pulse diagnosis (KPD);e-noising;terative sliding window (ISW)},   doi={10.1109/IIKI.2016.75},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Along with the fast development of the Internet of Things, the number of wireless communication devices increases rapidly in the near future, leading to very high time complexity for interference coordination, hence traditional schemes do not work properly anymore. To solve this problem, grouping scheme was proposed, which largely decreases the time complexity without obviously degrading the average spectral efficiency of the system. In this paper, we first work on the performance evaluation of grouping scheme and focus on the problem that the number of terminals may not be divided exactly by the number of groups. We find that simply dropping the rest terminals causes serious fluctuation of the simulation curves, which undermines the precision of the simulation. Then, we enhance the grouping scheme by carefully dealing with the rest terminals and find that putting the rest terminals into the outer groups with one terminal per group is the best method for the tradeoff between average spectral efficiency and time cost. In the end, we work on the fairness issue and propose an alternated grouping scheme which improve the fairness of the original scheme without degrading the average spectral efficiency.},   keywords={Internet of Things (IoT);Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC);4G;Fairness;Spectral Efficiency},   doi={10.1049/cp.2014.0582},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

CPS systems are rapidly becoming an important development strategies with broad application domains. The key requirements for CPS systems are to support multiple applications with many different resources at the same time in timeliness and also ensure energy efficiency. This paper presents the Cyber-Physical integrated cloud computing system called Cyber-Physical Cloud (CPC) to solve these key requirements. CPC architecture is designed for various applications such as health care, smart cars, traffic control, etc where multiple wireless sensor networks (WSNs) communicate with each other through mobile ad hoc network. Concurrently, CPC architecture can leverage cloud computing to process effectively computation and resource management by virtualization technique. Moreover, CPS systems are built on heterogeneous WSNs to collect and process the physical objects by obtaining data and thereafter processing queries. As a part of CPS systems, the key requirement for WSNs is to sustain a long lifetime because of limited power supplies. We work on real time preemptive query scheduling in WSNs with a focus on quality of data (QoD) to analysis useful energy consumption and interference energy consumption. We propose the Energy efficiency Aware Quality of Data (EAQD) method that runs on real time preemptive query scheduling to find the expected QoD for each query thus enabling energy consumption minimization. EAQD method also computes the transmitting/receiving slots needed for each query to avoid wasting slots. The simulation results show the our approach can reduce energy consumption up to 5 times as compares to previous approaches.},   keywords={cloud computing;energy conservation;health care;energy efficiency;cyber physical system;convergence;real physical world;computation world;CPS system;cloud computing;cyber-physical cloud;CPC architecture;health care;smart car;traffic control;wireless sensor network;mobile ad hoc network;virtualization;real time preemptive query scheduling;quality of data;interference energy consumption;EAQD method;energy consumption minimization;Real time systems;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Computer architecture;Sensors;cyber-physical systems;energy efficiency;quality of data;real time query scheduling},   doi={10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.61},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={586-592},   abstract={The integration of wireless sensor networks into Internet of things, led to a new generation of sensor nodes, directly connected to remote servers, for signal processing and decision making. The migration of data processing from local node, achieved by decoupling the node hardware from the required processing capabilities, is only possible through implementations of network softwarization. The softwarization which brings, new services that are executed remotely has led to security challenges, yet to be resolved, due to the increasing amount of data being continually exchanged between the sensor node-hub and the remote servers. In this regard we introduce a novel genetic algorithm for data security with a powerful security architecture that performs one-time key, single block enciphering instead of a block chaining or weak stream enciphering. The algorithm architecture produces variable (stealthy) keys and data that adopts white noise statistical behavior, therefore, having high immunity to cryptanalysis.

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), the IEEE 802.15.4 standard introduces wireless sensor network (WSN) from personal area network (PAN) into low power personal area network (LoWPAN). Hence, the use of Internet Protocol (IP) into LoWPAN has broadened new research area known as 6LoWPAN. Nowadays, 6LoWPAN technology is swiftly gaining recognition for its extensive application, ranging from healthcare to environmental monitoring. One of the challenges in 6LoWPAN is the route break often occurs due to node mobility, node failure and channel impairments. There are types of routing protocol that have been proposed to reroute or provide alternative routing to overcome the route break problem. However, the network is burdened of load RREQ the whole network. In this paper, we proposed LABC mechanism in the Local Route Repair using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm in 6LoWPAN network to enhance the routing against route breakage. We compare the packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay with scalable number of traffic and show that our routing protocol with LABC mechanism significantly reduce average end-to-end delay and increase number of packets delivery.},   keywords={optimisation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;Zigbee;LABC;local route repair;artificial bee colony algorithm;6LoWPAN network;Internet of Things;IEEE 802.15.4 standard;wireless sensor network;low power personal area network;routing protocol;alternative routing;route break problem;packet delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;Routing protocols;Maintenance engineering;Routing;Delays;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Wireless sensor networks;LABC;6L0WPANrouting;Swarm Intelligent},   doi={10.1109/ICCST.2014.7045181},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={171-176},   abstract={For the convenience of users, thousands of wearable devices with new built-in applications are appearing every year in the field of healthcare, sports, and safety. However, the system of them should be operated by using limited capacity of power because of very small size of battery that can be loaded into a wearable device due to the device properties. For such a reason, Chip Vendors are recently launching MCUs with ultra-low power capability on the market and also MCU that supports 7-step low power mode was appeared at present[1-3]. But now, it is very rare case to completely use Low Power Mode offered by MCU vendor on the operating system (OS) that is applied to wearable devices, and there is no case to support low power mode by the OS at the board level. Therefore, this paper suggests optimal supporting mechanism for ultra-low power multi-step mode at the OS level of wearable device. The mechanism proposed in this paper is largely divided into two parts. First, it is Low Power Mode Governor (LPMG) which is a module used to select an optimal low power mode after computation of retention time in idle mode. Second, we proposed Power-Off Mode, which disconnects power to the board when idle mode lasts for a long time. When integrating these two technologies and applying them to the Tickless nanoQplus[4], the OS for wearable devices developed at our lab, in the same Wearable Application Scenario 2 test, power consumption after passing a certain duration of time is reduced by 98.05% compared to idle mode, and 96.33% compared to sleep mode. These newly proposed two technologies will be able to offer an effective solution required to achieve low power consumption in wearable devices.},   keywords={operating systems (computers);multi level ultra low-power mode support mechanisms;wearable devices;operating system;OS level;low power mode governor;LPMG;power-off mode;Decision support systems;Conferences;Internet of Things;Green computing;Social computing;DPM;MCU;Low Power Mode;Wearable;RTOS},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.53},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

The medical staff within these facilities are in an environment where they depend on immediately knowing the location of a patient or other medical staff. McAllister et al. [1] proposed a solution named LoCATE (Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment) which uses existing technology to track all patients and medical staff in near real time. LoCATE makes use of the current wireless networks (e.g., WiFi) within a healthcare facility by using edge node technology as its tracking solution. It can locate an object within three to five feet of its calculated position. The ubiquity of WiFi infrastructure in healthcare facilities makes it an attractive option to use, as the backbone for a patient and staff tracking system. However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and edge nodes create security holes in networks and leak data to the open world. This paper aims to analyze what security holes and data leaks LoCATE creates in a healthcare facility. In this paper, we show the dangers of using simple and default passwords, the need to physically secure edge nodes, and the importance of securing data before transmission. We exploit the system's weak security measures by forging edge node data, gaining unauthorized access, performing denial of service attack, and launching other attacks.

In this paper, we first study privacy and security concerns with healthcare data acquisition and then transmission. Then, we propose a secure data collection scheme for IoT based healthcare system named SecureData with the aim to tackle security concerns similar to the above. SecureData scheme is comprised of four layers: IoT network sensors/devices, Fog layers, Cloud computing layer, and healthcare provider layer. We mainly contribute to the first three layers. For the first two layers, SecureData includes two techniques: light-weight FPGA hardware-based cipher algorithm and secret cipher share algorithm, respectively. We study KATAN algorithm and we implement and optimize it on the FPGA hardware platform, while we use the idea of secret cipher sharing technique to protect patients’ data privacy. At the cloud computing layer, we apply a distributed database technique that includes a number of cloud data servers to guarantee patients’ personal data privacy at the cloud computing layer. The performance of SecureData is validated through simulations with FPGA in terms of hardware frequency rate, energy cost, and computation time of all the algorithms and the results show that SecureData can be efficient when applying for protecting security risks in IoT-based healthcare.},   keywords={Medical services;Ciphers;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Data collection;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;data collection;hardware-based security;threats;secret cipher;privacy;healthcare.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2854714},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={3360-3378},   abstract={In forthcoming years, the Internet of Things (IoT) will connect billions of smart devices generating and uploading a deluge of data to the cloud. If successfully extracted, the knowledge buried in the data can significantly improve the quality of life and foster economic growth. However, a critical bottleneck for realizing the efficient IoT is the pressure it puts on the existing communication infrastructures, requiring transfer of enormous data volumes. Aiming at addressing this problem, we propose a novel architecture dubbed Condense which integrates the IoT-communication infrastructure into the data analysis. This is achieved via the generic concept of network function computation. Instead of merely transferring data from the IoT sources to the cloud, the communication infrastructure should actively participate in the data analysis by carefully designed en-route processing. We define the Condense architecture, its basic layers, and the interactions among its constituent modules. Furthermore, from the implementation side, we describe how Condense can be integrated into the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) machine type communications (MTCs) architecture, as well as the prospects of making it a practically viable technology in a short time frame, relying on network function virtualization and software-defined networking. Finally, from the theoretical side, we survey the relevant literature on computing atomic functions in both analog and digital domains, as well as on function decomposition over networks, highlighting challenges, insights, and future directions for exploiting these techniques within practical 3GPP MTC architecture.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;software defined networking;network function virtualization;MTC architecture;machine type communications;3GPP;third generation partnership project;IoT sources;network function computation;generic concept;data analysis;IoT-communication;data volumes;communication infrastructures;smart devices;Internet of Things;5G IoT;reconfigurable knowledge acquisition architecture;Internet of things;Computer architecture;3GPP;Cloud computing;Data analysis;Smart devices;5G mobile commuinication;Big data;Machine learning;Wireless communication;Internet of things (IoT);big data;network coding;network function computation;machine learning;wireless communications},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2585468},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={687-694},   abstract={Pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have recently been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Prevailing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare related services have made it difficult to handle all the data in an efficient and effective way and create more useful services. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Therefore, amalgamation of cloud computing with IoTs, termed as Cloud of Things (CoT) has recently been under discussion in research arena. CoT provides ease of management for the growing media content and other data. Besides this, features like: ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery, and resource provisioning play a significant role, which comes with CoT. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework for IoTs, which we provide in this paper. Our model covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type based resource estimation and reservation, advance reservation, and pricing for new and existing IoT customers, on the basis of their characteristics. The implementation was done using Java, while the model was evaluated using CloudSim toolkit.

 title={Smart Dairies — Enablement of Smart City at Gross Root Level}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={118-123},   abstract={Rural and urban areas are linked. A basic definition of rural-urban linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information, finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets [1]. Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between sectors (agriculture, industry and services). The latter is central to structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship. Cecilia [2] notes "in many regions of the world we are witnessing an increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand". This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with Dairy Industry. The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage. The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12% to 14% of world population [6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [3], "more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products; the majority of these people live in developing countries" [2]. It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic relationship and in order to make urban areas smart, aka Smart Cities, it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas, needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village, according to Viswanadham [7] "the existing infrastructure and services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.) need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires standardization, use of IT and sensor networks". In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Dementia, Autism, and Alzheimer's disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Suffering from forgetfulness, affected patients tend to wander off and potentially get into dangerous situations. This work introduces a mobile app, Alzimio, to provide two main alarm functions to these patients; safe-zone geofencing and activity-recognition. Caregivers designate certain activities (or zones) as dangerous, triggering alert message (with activity information) when detected. Several challenges must be overcome to achieve our goals. First, the activities and zones must be detected accurately in a timely fashion, and with high confidence. Second, the algorithms used should operate effectively on regular smartphones without special hardware. Such challenges are not unique to Alzimio, but are general to most Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare apps. In this study, we devise several novel activity-recognition algorithms to meet our goals of accuracy and efficiency. Our threshold-based algorithms intelligently filter and process the output of Android APIs for activity recognition and geofencing, at different time scales. The app was evaluated using extensive scenarios of usage for several months. We find that our max-in- window algorithm is able to achieve over 95% accuracy in less than 30 sec in most scenarios. The optimal threshold was found to be 65% confidence, to achieve best accuracy and delay. The Alzimio app runs efficiently on budget (low-end and medium) Android phones without noticeably affecting power consumption.},   keywords={application program interfaces;health care;medical computing;medical disorders;mobile computing;pattern recognition;Alzimio app;dementia;autism;Alzheimers disorder;activity recognition algorithms;mobile app;safe-zone geofencing;smartphones;threshold-based algorithms;Android API;max-in-window algorithm;Smart phones;Sensors;Autism;Dementia;Algorithm design and analysis},   doi={10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2016.7501720},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

 title={Leave Me Alone: App-Level Protection against Runtime Information Gathering on Android}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={915-930},   abstract={Stealing of sensitive information from apps is always considered to be one of the most critical threats to Android security. Recent studies show that this can happen even to the apps without explicit implementation flaws, through exploiting some design weaknesses of the operating system, e.g., Shared communication channels such as Bluetooth, and side channels such as memory and network-data usages. In all these attacks, a malicious app needs to run side-by-side with the target app (the victim) to collect its runtime information. Examples include recording phone conversations from the phone app, gathering WebMD's data usages to infer the disease condition the user looks at, etc. This runtime-information-gathering (RIG) threat is realistic and serious, as demonstrated by prior research and our new findings, which reveal that the malware monitoring popular Android-based home security systems can figure out when the house is empty and the user is not looking at surveillance cameras, and even turn off the alarm delivered to her phone. To defend against this new category of attacks, we propose a novel technique that changes neither the operating system nor the target apps, and provides immediate protection as soon as an ordinary app (with only normal and dangerous permissions) is installed. This new approach, called App Guardian, thwarts a malicious app's runtime monitoring attempt by pausing all suspicious background processes when the target app (called principal) is running in the foreground, and resuming them after the app stops and its runtime environment is cleaned up. Our technique leverages a unique feature of Android, on which third-party apps running in the background are often considered to be disposable and can be stopped anytime with only a minor performance and utility implication. We further limit such an impact by only focusing on a small set of suspicious background apps, which are identified by their behaviors inferred from their side channels (e.g., Thread names, CPU scheduling and kernel time). App Guardian is also carefully designed to choose the right moments to start and end the protection procedure, and effectively protect itself against malicious apps. Our experimental studies show that this new technique defeated all known RIG attacks, with small impacts on the utility of legitimate apps and the performance of the OS. Most importantly, the idea underlying our approach, including app-level protection, side-channel based defense and lightweight response, not only significantly raises the bar for the RIG attacks and the research on this subject but can also inspire the follow-up effort on new detection systems practically deployable in the fragmented Android ecosystem.},   keywords={cryptography;Internet of Things;invasive software;mobile computing;smart phones;app-level protection;runtime information gathering;RIG threat;Android security;malware monitoring;App Guardian;side-channel based defense;Internet of Things;IoT;Smart phones;Security;Runtime;Bluetooth;Monitoring;Androids;Humanoid robots},   doi={10.1109/SP.2015.61},   ISSN={1081-6011},   month={May},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-3},   abstract={Recently, the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is attracting much attention due to the huge potential. IoT uses the Internet as a key infrastructure to interconnect numerous geographically diversified IoT nodes which usually have scare resources, and therefore cloud is used as a key back-end supporting infrastructure. In the literature, the collection of the IoT nodes and the cloud is collectively called as an IoT cloud. Unfortunately, the IoT cloud suffers from various drawbacks such as huge network latency as the volume of data which is being processed within the system increases. To alleviate this issue, the concept of fog computing is introduced, in which foglike intermediate computing buffers are located between the IoT nodes and the cloud infrastructure to locally process a significant amount of regional data. Compared to the original IoT cloud, the communication latency as well as the overhead at the backend cloud infrastructure could be significantly reduced in the fog computing supported IoT cloud, which we will refer as IoT fog. Consequently, several valuable services, which were difficult to be delivered by the traditional IoT cloud, can be effectively offered by the IoT fog. In this paper, however, we argue that the adoption of IoT fog introduces several unique security threats. We first discuss the concept of the IoT fog as well as the existing security measures, which might be useful to secure IoT fog. Then, we explore potential threats to IoT fog.},   keywords={cloud computing;data privacy;Internet of Things;security of data;privacy issues;security issues;fog computing;Internet of Things environment;IoT nodes;back-end supporting infrastructure;IoT cloud;network latency;cloud infrastructure;communication latency;back-end cloud infrastructure;security threats;IoT fog;Cloud computing;Security;Privacy;Internet of things;Sensors;Real-time systems;Distributed databases},   doi={10.1109/NOF.2015.7333287},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

The challenge in these networks is to enable efficient video analytics: the ability to process videos cheaply and quickly to enable searching for specific events or sequences of events. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of Kestrel, a video analytics system that tracks the path of vehicles across a heterogeneous camera network. In Kestrel, fixed camera feeds are processed on the cloud, and mobile devices are invoked only to resolve ambiguities in vehicle tracks. Kestrel's mobile device pipeline detects objects using a deep neural network, extracts attributes using cheap visual features, and resolves path ambiguities by careful association of vehicle visual descriptors, while using several optimizations to conserve energy and reduce latency.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={43602-43611},   abstract={Wearable thermoelectric generator (TEG) is an attractive technology to enable self-powered electronics and sensors for healthcare and the Internet of Things through its ability to convert body heat into electricity. However, the actual inner temperature gradient in the thermoelectric legs is relatively small when a TEG is worn on the body, which leads to a low voltage and power generation. To enhance the output performance, the structural design of a wearable TEG with copper foam as the heat sink is proposed. A thermal resistance model was developed to investigate the effects of using copper foam heat sink on the heat transfer and performance of the TEG. In addition, for comparison, the inner temperature gradients and open-circuit voltages of the TEGs with and without plate-fin heat sink were analyzed. Then, these different TEGs were fabricated and tested using an experimental setup. The results showed that TEGs with heat sinks could generate greater open-circuit voltage and output power values, while the TEG with copper-foam heat sink achieved the highest power-to-weight ratio. Finally, a wearable TEG with copper-foam heat sink was connected to a step-up circuit and worn on the wrist to power a miniaturized accelerometer for body motion detection. The results demonstrated that the wearable TEG with the copper-foam heat sink design provided a potential pathway for the realization of electronics powered by harvesting the human body heat.},   keywords={Heat sinks;Heat transfer;Copper;Resistance heating;Thermal resistance;Legged locomotion;Copper foam;heat sink;power-to-weight ratio;thermal resistance model;wearable TEG},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2863018},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={299-300},   abstract={We are concerned with IoT applications where communication among resource constrained, battery powered devices exchange data wirelessly. Traditionally, these devices keep energy consump- tion at bay by sending their radio to sleep according to a pre-de ned duty cycle (Low Power Listening, or LPL). This, however, increases data latency dramatically. In order to reduce these delays, recent research has investigated the use of wake-up radios, namely, ad- ditional low-cost, ultra-low power radios operating at a di erent frequency than the main radio. In this way, by spending energy comparable to that of a node in sleep mode nodes can wake up their neighbors as soon as they have a packet to send, no longer needing to wait for the neighbors to wake up. This demonstration provides evidence of how by using wake-up radios we can abate the latency imposed by LPL. We show a simple chat application where messages from Alice to Bob are transmitted concurrently between two pairs of MagoNodes++, one with wake-up capabilities and the other using LPL. For each message received by Bob, latency information is shown, along with information regarding the time when the main radio is on. This allows us to clearly quantify the advantage of using wake-up radios for faster message exchange and for shortening the time the main radio is unnecessarily on.},   keywords={data communication;Internet of Things;abating LPL-induced latency;wake-up radio technology;IoT applications;battery powered devices exchange data;energy consumption;wake-up radios;ofMagoNodes++;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Portable computers;Receivers;Low-power electronics;Transducers;Computer science;Wake-up radio;low-latency IoT applications},   doi={},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

 title={Leveraging edge analysis for Internet of Things based healthcare solutions}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={720-725},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications give rise to an unprecedented amount of data that requires transfer, processing/analysis and storage. Often times, the norm is to maximize the capability of cloud computing services and infrastructure in running complex algorithms on data associated with IoT devices, in order to extract useful information, as well as harnessing its storage services. The downsides of employing cloud computing services include unacceptable latency, high storage cost, increased network bandwidth, etc. However, edge computing eliminates the problems of data communication latency of cloud computing, by processing data at its source. Thus, devices not continuously connected to the Internet can be used for data processing and analysis. Also due to the heterogeneous nature of devices used in data collection, the necessary data integration prior to analysis poses a challenge to developers of IoT solutions and products. The use of a middleware platform was harnessed to solve this problem. In this paper, we employ the use of an edge computing platform for analyzing data generated by IoT devices used in providing healthcare services. This is especially important as such services require real-time analytical results for health monitoring and diagnosis. The system depicted in this work is based on a proposed patient-centric architecture for remotely monitoring patients, and comprises of a biosensor, a smartphone, and an edge analytics platform for data analysis. The biosensor (heart rate sensor) used for this work collects physiological data from the patient and sends it via Bluetooth to the smartphone, which hosts a mobile application, “HealthMate”, that pre-processes the sensor data, transfers it to the edge computing platform server, Kaa server, for further data analysis and storage.

In this paper, we propose a novel prototyping platform to enable comprehensive NoS design space exploration. Fast and accurate host-compiled system models are combined with a standard network simulator to provide a unified network/system co-simulation framework. Furthermore, detailed models of network interfaces and protocol stacks are integrated into host-compiled system and OS models to allow accurately capturing of network and system interactions. We apply our NoS simulator to two case studies from smart camera and healthcare application domains, and we demonstrate benefits and opportunities for exploration and optimization in network/system co-design.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={849-854},   abstract={With the increase in popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), pervasive computing, healthcare services, sensor networks, and mobile devices, a lot of data is being generated at the perception layer. Cloud is the most viable solution for data storage, processing, and management. Cloud also helps in the creation of further services, refined according to the context and requirement. However, being reachable through the Internet, cloud is not efficient enough for latency sensitive multimedia services and other time-sensitive services, like emergency and healthcare. Fog, an extended cloud lying within the proximity of underlying nodes, can mitigate the issues traditional cloud cannot solve being standalone. Fog can provide quick response to the requiring applications. Moreover, it can preprocess and filter data according to the requirements. Trimmed data is then sent to the cloud for further analysis and enhanced service provisioning. However, how much better is it to have a fog in any particular scenario instead of a standalone cloud working without fog is a question right now. In this paper, we provide an answer by analyzing both cloud-only and cloud-fog scenarios in the context of processing delay and power consumption according to increasing number of users, on the basis of varying server load. The simulation is done through Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS).

Internet of Things which is a culmination of data centric and address centric networks have brought in a need to integrate various technologies which were otherwise in silos. The basic requirement of Internet of Things (IoT), is connecting anything, anytime and anywhere. Thus, our paper attempts to provide a brief idea of existing methodologies towards integration and propose a new architecture for Internet of Things towards integration of these most useful networks to the internet. As the volume of things connected have increased multifold have brought in new challenges with respect to monitoring and management of resources and data. Thus, this architecture is inspired from Software Defined concepts and attempts to divide the monitoring and the actual data into two layers namely the control and the data plane. The control plane will take care of dynamic resource discovery and provisioning based on user needs. The data plane deals only with pure/raw data. This model reduces the complexity by abstracting the control task from the data bounded physical layer.},   keywords={computer network management;Internet of Things;software defined networking;virtualisation;wireless sensor networks;virtual sensor layer;data centric networks;address centric networks;data plane;control plane based virtual sensor layer;Internet of Things;software defined concepts;dynamic resource discovery;data bounded physical layer;Protocols;Internet of Things;Wireless sensor networks;Standards;Servers;Service-oriented architecture;Data centric networks;Internet of Things (IoT);Software Defined Network(SDN)},   doi={10.1109/ICIOTA.2017.8073633},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={Edge computing has evolved to be a promising avenue to enhance system computing capability by offloading processing tasks from the cloud to edge devices. In this article, we propose a multi-layer edge computing framework called EdgeFlow. In this framework, different nodes ranging from edge devices to cloud data centers are categorized into corresponding layers and cooperate for data processing. EdgeFlow can deal with the trade-off between the computing and communication capabilities so that the tasks can be assigned to each layer optimally. At the same time, resources are carefully allocated throughout the whole network to mitigate performance fluctuation. The proposed open-source data flow processing framework is implemented on a platform that can emulate various computing nodes in multiple layers and corresponding network connections. Evaluated on the face recognition scenario, EdgeFlow can significantly reduce task finish time and perform more tolerance to run-time variations, compared with pure cloud computing, pure edge computing, and Cloudlet. Potential applications of EdgeFlow, including network function virtualization, Internet of Things, and vehicular networks, are also discussed at the end of this article.},   keywords={Task analysis;Edge computing;Data processing;Process control;Cloud computing;Wireless communication;Schedules},   doi={10.1109/MNET.2018.1800001},   ISSN={0890-8044},   month={},}

 title={PESA: Probabilistic Efficient Storage Algorithm for Time-Domain Spectrum Measurements}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-9},   abstract={Wireless communication is an essential part of daily life for users globally with applications in medical devices, cellular phones, Internet of Things nodes, and others. Accordingly, there is a need to understand the patterns and properties of radio-frequency spectrum use by acquiring accurate spectrum utilization measurements. However, the massive storage volume needed to execute spectrum surveys-especially when a fast sampling rate is used--is an impeding factor in terms of cost and ease-of-access. In this paper, a probabilistic efficient storage algorithm (PESA) is proposed to facilitate high-accuracy, time-domain spectrum surveys conducted at a fast sample acquisition rate to detect sporadic spectrum occupancy patterns that could be in the order of microseconds. PESA divides the dynamic range of monitoring equipment into bins--each represented by one component of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Windows of activity and inactivity in the measurements are established by comparing with a threshold, and then indicators to the GMM component that best describes a window are recorded, hence reducing the required storage volume. Results demonstrate that ≈99% reduction in the storage volume is achievable while maintaining an accurate estimation of channel utilization (CU) and activity/inactivity periods. Furthermore, a LabVIEW implementation of PESA on a hardware platform was executed and used to survey Wi-Fi channel 1 in a healthcare environment for seven consecutive hours. Although more than 25 billion samples were observed, the resulting data only occupied 96.28 MB.},   keywords={Wireless communication;Time-domain analysis;Wireless fidelity;Volume measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Time-frequency analysis;Cognitive radio;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);Internet of Things (IoT);spectrum survey;Wi-Fi;wireless coexistence},   doi={10.1109/TIM.2018.2851678},   ISSN={0018-9456},   month={},}

Its advances, among other things, enable new opportunities for better health services but, as a side effect, it introduces new threats to privacy. If anywhere, it is in the health care sector that privacy is of utmost importance. Knowing further that internet of things devices typically lack computing and energy resources, the need for providing appropriate privacy is a hard issue. This paper therefore addresses privacy for internet of things technologies by focusing on the most "primitive" members, bare sensors and RFIDs. Based on lessons learned in this domain, a strategy of incrementally adjusting existing protocols is adopted for deployment in the area of wireless medical sensors body area networks. By doing so, new contributions that are quantifiably lightweight and that enable privacy, together with confidential exchange of captured measured quantities, are provided. In addition to such hard security solutions, the paper addresses trust management methods as a complementary, soft mean for security provisioning. This latter contribution also paves the way for further development and for applications of pervasive computing in general.},   keywords={biomedical communication;computer network security;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;radiofrequency identification;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks;hard security provisioning;soft security provisioning;computationally weak pervasive computing systems;electronic health;e-health;health care sector;data privacy;Internet of Things technology;primitive member;bare sensors;RFID;wireless medical sensor deployment;body area network deployment;Protocols;Security;Computer security;Logic gates;Radiofrequency identification;Wireless sensor networks;Electronic medical records;Medical services;Pervasive computing},   doi={10.1109/MWC.2013.6590047},   ISSN={1536-1284},   month={August},}

IoT devices can be deployed and linked to cloud services using local Wi-Fi and cellular Internet connections via IPv6. However, as a distributed environment for an open market and a rich source of "big data" with unlimited systems interactions, the IoT would allow attackers to identify many vulnerable targets and to launch their attacks. Such vulnerabilities and attacks could have an impact on any number of services and systems within and across different critical infrastructures. The major problem is that the existing IoT mechanisms and protocols have not been designed to deal with such challenges. Therefore, the security of the IoT has come into question which means that, in order to be secure, the IoT will require robust and secure objects, protocols and systems. Recent advances in the fields of IoT such as embedded systems security, industrial malware analysis, detection and prevention are a key factor in the growth of IoT services and operations. This paper is concerned with the growing dependence of modern society on wireless technologies and on the role of IoT in the healthcare sector in particular. IoT systems and their users are vulnerable to a range of security threats and malicious activities.

An accurate temperature sensor usually requires carefully calibrated, high-accuracy ADCs, which prevents their use in ultra-low-power sensor nodes. In some sensing architectures, a highly accurate timing reference can replace the ADC [1]. With this in mind, we observe that almost all IoT systems incorporate a high-accuracy timing source (real-time clock, RTC) for time synchronization, data recording, and radio communication. Typically, these RTCs employ crystal or MEMS-based oscillators, or RC oscillators in extremely small form factor devices. We therefore propose to build a temperature sensor that uses a system's core RTC as a timing reference to minimize power/area overhead. We also show a fully integrated sensor that includes an RC-based timing circuit for systems that might not have a timing source.},   keywords={analogue-digital conversion;clocks;Internet of Things;temperature sensors;temperature sensor;exponential subthreshold oscillation dependence;thermal sensing;IoT devices;environmental conditions;system conditions;chip conditions;ADC;timing reference;IoT systems;real-time clock;RTC;time synchronization;data recording;radio communication;crystal oscillators;MEMS based oscillators;RC oscillators;form factor devices;integrated sensor;RC-based timing circuit;Temperature sensors;Oscillators;Timing;Sensitivity;Temperature measurement;Temperature dependence},   doi={10.1109/ISSCC.2017.7870310},   ISSN={2376-8606},   month={Feb},}

Internet of Things (IoT) is the new technology which includes the collection of Sensors, Actuators, processors and other development boards (eg. Raspberry pi, Arduino etc) to collect the data from different sources depending upon domain of application, process the acquired data before sending to distant cloud or mobile application depending upon the requirement[7]. The most promising application of IoT is in the field of health care sector. In some countries, people still do not have access to quality health facilities owing to different barriers. The physical distance between patient and clinic is one of the foremost reasons. This paper studies the application of IoT in health care domain and a system is proposed to monitor the ECG of the distant patient. In the proposed system the Bio signals are collected from the Body of the patient using ECG sensor and after the required processing using development boards, sent to distant cloud named as Bluemix[14] which is owned by IBM, for further analysis by a physician or other authorized person. The Bluemix cloud uses MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol which is used to connect different types of applications and devices together across the globe.

 title={Internet of things baseline method to improve health sterilization in hospitals: An approach from electronic instrumentation and processing of steam quality}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Sterilization in hospitals is performed due to the need of attacking and killing bacteria that can be dangerous for patients when intervened with medical instrumentation. In that sense, sterilization autoclaves are used, and controlling both temperature and pressure, bacteria are killed. Nonetheless, in some cases the level of humidity in the internal atmosphere is highly relevant to guarantee the success of the process. This variable is controlled by knowing the steam quality, however, it is not monitored online, but sampling is performed a few times a year, so pertinent adjustments are carried out into the boiler when needed. This periodic maintenance does not guarantee that the process is effective. On the other hand, instruments for monitoring steam quality are expensive, and cannot be afforded by many hospitals. As a result, a cheaper determination of steam quality is carried out by using chemical instruments like test tubes, adding critical errors in the measurements. In this paper a cost-effective measuring and processing method by implementing Internet of Things - IoT-techniques is proposed, based on strangulation calorimeter. All the calculations are performed in a Single Board Computer which is connected to an IoT platform for logging data, supervise in pseudo real time and use statistical tools to inference or predict. As a result, the IoT node can achieve measurement errors up to 0.25% FS, against 5.6% FS of traditional method. Furthermore, the inclusion of pseudo real time monitoring, allows maintenance staff to fix problems even in a predictive way.},   keywords={computerised monitoring;health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;measurement errors;microorganisms;steam;sterilisation (microbiological);hospitals;chemical instruments;pseudoreal time monitoring;health sterilization;electronic instrumentation;medical instrumentation;sterilization autoclaves;cost-effective processing method;bacteria;cost-effective measuring method;IoT-techniques;Internet of Things baseline method;steam quality processing;steam quality monitoring;measurement errors;Instruments;Hospitals;Temperature measurement;Liquids;Microorganisms;Internet of Things;Containers;Internet of Things;hospital;instrumentation;sterilization;steam quality},   doi={10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399370},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

In-home remote patient monitoring applications harnessing technological advancements in the area of Internet of things (IoT), semantic web, data analytics, and cloud computing have emerged as viable alternatives. However, such applications generate large amounts of real-time data in terms of volume, velocity, and variety thus making it a big data problem. Hence, the challenge is how to combine and analyse such data with historical patient data to obtain meaningful diagnoses suggestions within acceptable time frames (considering quality of service (QoS)). Despite the evolution of big data processing technologies (e.g. Hadoop) and scalable infrastructure (e.g. clouds), there remains a significant gap in the areas of heterogeneous data collection, real-time patient monitoring, and automated decision support (semantic reasoning) based on well-defined QoS constraints.

 title={The Accuracy and Efficacy of Real-Time Compressed ECG Signal Reconstruction on a Heterogeneous Multicore Edge-Device}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={458-463},   abstract={Typical real-time remote health monitoring architectures consist of wearable medical devices continuously transmitting physiological signals to a nearby gateway which routes the data to an remote internet of things (IoT)-platform. Unfortunately, this model falls-short under the strict requirements of healthcare systems. Wearable medical devices have short battery lifespans, the system reliance on a cloud makes it vulnerable to connectivity and latency issues, and there are privacy concerns related to streaming sensitive medical data to remote servers. The compressive sensing (CS) scheme has been explored in the context of bio-signals to reduce the energy consumption of wearable sensors. However, CS does not address the other limitations caused by the model's reliance on cloud-computing but exacerbates the associated computing latency by requiring a computationally complex reconstruction process. In our remote elderly monitoring system, we attempt to address this weakness by developing a gateway-centric connected health system, where most signal processing and analysis occurs locally on heterogeneous multicore edge-devices. This paper explores the efficacy of real-time reconstruction of ECG signals, compressed under the CS scheme, on an IoT-gateway powered by ARM's big. LITTLE multicore solution at different signal dimension and allocated computational resources. Experimental results show the gateway's capability to reconstruct ECG signals in real-time, even when considering dimensionally large windows and minimum computational resources. Moreover, they demonstrate that utilizing more cores for the reconstruction process has a higher impact on execution time and is more energy efficient than increasing the cores' frequency. The optimal resource allocation for the majority of cases is a single big (A15) core at minimum frequency as it provides extreme fast reconstruction while consuming less or slightly more energy than its LITTLE (A7) counterpart. Heterogeneous multicore devices have the computational capacity and energy efficiency to elevate some of the limitations of a cloud-based remote health monitoring and can help create a more sustainable IoT-based connected health.},   keywords={Multicore processing;Real-time systems;Electrocardiography;Sensors;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Microsoft Windows;Remote health monitoring;connected health;compressive sensing;heterogeneous multicore platforms;edge computing},   doi={10.1109/DSD.2018.00082},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

A burst transmission scheme, to repeat the identical data packet with a combination of a short time interval and a long time interval, is developed to save the power consumption by decreasing the total number of transmitted packets compared to a regular-interval transmission scheme. Simulation results show that the time interval dominates the performance of the probability of packet success transmission under time-varying channels with the mobility at a walking speed. It is also shown that a careful allocation of frequency channel used for the repeated packet can reduce the number of repeated packets to achieve a specific probability of packet success transmission under a slower fading channel, i.e., a quasi-static channel, which leads to the saving of the battery power consumption.},   keywords={advertising;cellular radio;data communication;fading channels;Internet of Things;multipath channels;probability;Rayleigh channels;time-varying channels;wireless channels;battery power consumption;slower fading channel;time-varying channels;regular-interval transmission scheme;transmitted packets;long time interval;short time interval;identical data packet;burst transmission scheme;packet success transmission;repeated packet;frequency channel;slow fading channels;low power wide area systems;narrowband wireless communications system;data packets;repeated transmission;IoT data transmission system;advertising;packet repetition format;Fading channels;Correlation;Power demand;Time-frequency analysis;Delays;Coherence;Standards},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269113},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={858-862},   abstract={As a new research area, Digital Forensics is a subject in a rapidly developing society. Cyber Security for Big Data in the Cloud is getting more attention than ever. A computing breach requires digital forensics to seize digital evidence to determine who is responsible and what has been done maliciously and the possible further consequences. In particular, for Big Data attack cases, Digital Forensics is facing even more challenge for earlier digital breach investigations. For the PPI (Protection of Personal Information) a GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law has been launched to be implemented from the 25<sup>th</sup>May 2018. This compulsory regulation will have an important impact on healthcare PPI in the cloud (ICO, 2017, Deloitte, 2014). Nowadays, Big Data with the characteristics of three “V”s (Volume, Velocity, and Variety), are either synchronized with the Cloud, or stored in the Cloud, in order to solve the storage capacity and so on problems, which made Digital Forensics investigation even more difficult. The Big Data Digital Forensics issue for the Cloud is difficult. One of them is the need to identify which physical devices have been compromised. Data are distributed in the Cloud, so the customer or digital forensics practitioner cannot have full access control like the traditional investigation does. Smart City are making use of ICT (information communications technology) to collect, detect, analyze and integrate the key information data of core systems in running the cities. Meanwhile, the Control Centre is making intelligent responses to different requirements that include daily livelihood, PPI security, environmental protection, public safety, industrial and commercial activities and city services. The Smart City healthcare Big Data are collected and gathered by the IoT (Internet of Things) (Liu, 2014, Qi, 2016) and applying GDPR prevent Cyberstalking and Cybercrimes.

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={1375-1384},   abstract={Industrial systems always prefer to reduce their operational expenses. To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security.

Thus, a new generation of smart wearable devices for health monitoring is being developed, able to perform complex Digital Signal Processing (DSP) routines that extract features of clinical relevance from the acquired data. These new edge computing sensors for personalized healthcare must operate within a tight energy envelope; addressing the ensuing challenge, we herein introduce an inexact and heterogeneous edge computing architecture, specifically tailored to the bio-DSP domain. We observe that bio-signal analysis applications present task-level parallelism, intensive computational hotspots and a high degree of resilience towards errors. These characteristics drive our new bio-DSP edge node architecture design composed of multiple processing cores, a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) accelerator, and hardware-software co-design support to become resilient to a non-zero probability of bit-flips at runtime. All these characteristics enable our new bio-DSP architecture to operate with an ultra-low voltage operating point. Indeed our results indicate that the energy benefits attained from the inclusion of all these characteristics in bio-DSP architectures are more than additive: task parallelism is harnessed both at the processor and the accelerator level, and the high tolerance of the CGRA towards voltage down-scaling is exploited to further decrease the IoT edge bio-DSP system energy envelope.},   keywords={Kernel;Random access memory;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Runtime;Synchronization;Sensors},   doi={10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351595},   ISSN={2379-447X},   month={May},}

For validation of the proposed architecture, we implemented the ISO/IEEE 11073-based healthcare services using 6LoWPAN and BLE. We also performed testbed experimentation.

This digital transformation is paving the way to new forms of care based on real-time analysis of huge amounts of data produced by sensors, which is seen as a basis for improving clinical efficiency and helping to save lives. A medical sensor typically produces several KBs of data per second so the collection and analysis of these data can be approached with Big Data technologies. The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate a hybrid architecture for real-time anomaly detection from data streams coming from sensors attached to patients. The architecture includes an edge computing data staging platform based on Raspberry Pi 3 for data logging, data transformation in RDF triple and data streaming towards a cluster computing running Apache Kafka for collecting RDFStreams, Apache Flink for running a parallel version of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithm and Cassandra for data storing. The different layers of the architecture have been evaluated in terms of both CPU performance and memory usage using the REALDISP dataset.},   keywords={Big Data;health care;intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;Big Data technologies;real-time anomaly detection;edge computing data staging platform;Raspberry Pi 3;data storing;medical smart sensors;internet of medical things;IoMT;healthcare;Apache Kafka;hierarchical temporal memory algorithm;Cassandra;cluster computing;Medical services;Computer architecture;Big Data;Real-time systems;Biomedical monitoring;Wearable sensors;eHealth;IoMT;wearables;Big Data;stream computing},   doi={10.1109/AINA.2018.00108},   ISSN={2332-5658},   month={May},}

 title={Building secure healthcare services using OAuth 2.0 and JSON web token in IOT cloud scenario}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={99-104},   abstract={OAuth 2.0 is a delegated authorization framework enabling secure authorization for applications running on various kinds of platforms. In healthcare services, OAuth allows the patient (resource owner) seeking real time clinical care to authorize automatic monthly payments from his bank account (resource server) without the patient being required to supply his credentials to the clinic (client app). OAuth 2.0 achieves this with the help of tokens issued by an authorization server which enables validated access to a protected resource. To ensure security, access tokens have an expiry time and are short-lived. So the clinical app may use a refresh token to obtain a new access token to cash monthly payments for rendering real time health care services. Refresh tokens need secure storage to ensure they are not leaked, since any malicious party can use them to obtain new access and refresh tokens. Since OAuth 2.0 has dropped signatures and relies completely on SSL/TLS, it is vulnerable to phishing attack when accessing interoperable APIs. In this paper, we develop an approach that combines JSON web token (JWT) with OAuth 2.0 to request an OAuth access token from authorization server when a client wishes to utilize a previous authentication and authorization. Experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme is practically efficient, removes secure storage overhead by removing the need to have or store refresh token, uses signature and prevents different security attacks which is highly desired in health care services using an IOT cloud platform.},   keywords={application program interfaces;authorisation;bank data processing;computer crime;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;open systems;real-time systems;secure health care services;OAuth 2.0;JSON Web token;IoT cloud scenario;authorization framework;real time clinical care;automatic monthly payments;bank account;phishing attack;interoperable API;Medical services;Authorization;Servers;Authentication;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;OAuth 2.0;Json Web Token;IOT;Authorization},   doi={10.1109/IC3I.2016.7917942},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

This creates the need for continuous data streaming in IoT architectures which are mainly designed following the broadcast model. As more devices communicate with each other via the Internet, it will be crucial to determine the origins of requests and responses. Being able to store records related to the life cycle of requests and responses in an immutable form will provide documentary evidence that will help to establish transparency and accountability within the IoT. Previous works employed provenance techniques to address this problem but focus on the request perspective. However, little or nothing has been done regarding the response perspective. Consequently, this paper proposes and develops a blockchain-based provenance system to trace bi-directionally the sources of requests and responses in the IoT.

This technological integration opened up new possibilities in many disciplines including healthcare and well-being. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs and providing improved and reliable services, several healthcare frameworks based on Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) have been developed. However, due to the critical and heterogeneous nature of healthcare data, maintaining high quality of service (QoS) -in terms of faster responsiveness and data-specific complex analytics -has always been the main challenge in designing such systems. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a five-layered heterogeneous mist, fog, and cloud based IoHT framework capable of efficiently handling and routing (near-)real-time as well as offline/batch mode data. Also, by employing software defined networking and link adaptation based load balancing, the framework ensures optimal resource allocation and efficient resource utilization. The results, obtained by simulating the framework, indicate that the designed network via its various components can achieve high QoS, with reduced end-to-end latency and packet drop rate, which is essential for developing next generation e-healthcare systems.},   keywords={Medical services;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Edge computing;Quality of service;Monitoring;Healthcare big data;healthcare application;data fusion;real-time computing;resource allocation;quality of service;load balancing.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876088},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

This study analyzes telemedicine services between patient and doctor, especially medical information security of clinics and medium-size hospitals because these clinics and hospitals typically use PCs, servers, and vendor software. Furthermore, these clinics and hospitals usually do not employ security specialists and are more vulnerable to medical information security threats.

Addition of enormous number of M2M devices into the cellular networks poses a heavy competition to existing Human-to-Human (H2H) devices for getting radio resources, thereby affecting the performance of the H2H communications. But, one can not treat all M2M flows as low priority and schedule them after H2H flows, as there are many M2M applications like healthcare and tracking which are of high importance and delay-intolerant. Hence, there is a need for class based priority scheduling of the traffic of M2M and H2H sessions in the network. In this paper, we propose a class based dynamic priority scheduling algorithm for uplink transmission of M2M and H2H traffic in LTE. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by various metrics such as H2H throughput and system throughput and also compared with existing schedulers.},   keywords={cellular radio;Long Term Evolution;class based dynamic priority scheduling algorithm;M2M communications;machine-to-machine communication;cellular service providers;LTE networks;M2M devices;human-to-human devices;H2H communications;uplink transmission;Delays;Throughput;Uplink;Resource management;Internet;Heuristic algorithms;Scheduling algorithms},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803179},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

 title={Health 4.0: The case of multiple sclerosis}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and variable disease in matters of symptoms, clinical course and outcome. The ultimate goal of currently used drugs and therapeutic strategies is the control of disease activity and the delay of the ongoing disability. During the last decades, a number of disease-modifying drugs (DMDs), all products of advanced biotechnology are being used. However, these DMDs are yet partially effective since the ongoing disability progression may hardly be prevented. There is growing evidence that these DMDs might be more effective if more accurate monitoring of the disease itself throughout a period of time might be available. In the new era of MS treatment and on the basis of our current knowledge about MS management, it became pretty clear that the overall therapeutic strategy should always be scheduled on strictly individualized basis. To this, MS patients should be encouraged to take control over their own disease and collaborate more effectively with their doctors. The advent of the IoT (Internet of Things) and 5G mobile technologies can support patients in this direction. Since a snapshot of the overall patient's condition during a regular follow-up visit may not represent the every day reality of the patient, the advice given under these conditions may not be that effective. However, if hard data on the patient's motoric and cognitive performance were available “theragnostics” might be much more effective and efficient and a typical flare-up of the condition might be recognized much earlier - or even anticipated. Health 4.0 is the translation of Industrie 4.0 design principles into the health domain [36]. Health 4.0 is based on the utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the use of cyber-physical systems to connect the physical and the virtual world. The use of smart pharmaceuticals bio-sensors and cyber-physical systems in the management of MS could optimize the accuracy and allow for a precise mapping of symptoms over time which is an inevitable prerequisite for personalization of care. Ideally captured data would be processed in real time in order to flag problems up to the care team and on an individual basis anticipate motoric and / or cognitive deficits in an attempt to compensate for neurological deficits. 5G networks are expected to provide the infrastructure and ease in supporting various parameters recording on a real time basis. Relevant clinical studies may further highlight the need of information communication technology in MS management, thus contributing to the overall improvement of patent's quality of life (QoL). This is an absolute necessity for a variable, fluctuating and largely unpredictable disease such as MS.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;biotechnology;cognition;cyber-physical systems;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;patient treatment;Health 4.0:;disease- modifying drugs;(DMDs);advanced biotechnology;disability progression;disease monitoring;MS treatment;MS management;overall therapeutic strategy;MS patients;IoT;Internet of Things;5G mobile technologies;patient motoric performance;patient cognitive performance;cyber-physical systems;smart pharmaceuticals bio-sensors;neurological deficits;5G networks;quality-of-life;QoL;Multiple Sclerosis;5G networks;e/m-Health;Cyber-physical systems;Health 4.0;Theragnostics;Smart pharmaceuticals;IoT;Individualized Medicine},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2016.7749437},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

Such devices generate a massive volume of heterogeneous data, which lead a system towards a major computational challenges, such as aggregation, storing, and processing. Also, a major problem arises when there is a need to extract useful information from this massive volume of data. Therefore, to address these needs, this paper proposes an architecture to analyze big data in the IoT. The basic concept involves the partitioning of dynamic data, i.e., big data with the complex magnitude is divided into subsets. These subsets are based on the theoretical model of data fusion, which works in the Hadoop processing server to enhance the computational efficiency.

Nowadays, homes and cities become smarter by installing sensors and actuators to manage energy consumption through WSNs and IoT integration. According to the demand, loads are shut off or can be shifted to off-peak times. The 2030 and 2050 visions of Electrical power system are not only to deliver energy from suppliers to consumers but also to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) into the electrical power system to reduce the cost, optimize the energy and increase the reliability. Though Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is used to monitor high power transmission, low and medium voltages are less monitored and controlled. This paper proposes an architecture for IoT smart grid (SG) to monitor and control low and medium voltage networks. Since WSNs is being incorporated, careful designing of energy efficient routing protocol is critical due to limited power of sensor nodes (SNs) and the spread of information in WSNs. This motivates our research to propose an IPv6 compatible hierarchical routing protocol based on clustering for IoT SG. The simulation results of the proposed IPv6 routing protocol achieves extended network lifetime for WSNs and shorter delay compared to standardized RPL.},   keywords={Internet of Things;IP networks;routing protocols;SCADA systems;smart power grids;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks;WSNs;smart cities;environmental monitoring;industry process control;energy consumption;IoT integration;electrical power system;Supervisory Control;high power transmission;IoT smart grid;low voltage networks;medium voltage networks;energy efficient routing protocol;IoT SG;IPv6 routing protocol;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks;Power systems;Routing;Monitoring;Companies;Information and communication technology;Smart Grid (SG);IPv6/LowPAN;Collection Tree Protocol (CTP);RPL;LOADng;IETF;information and communication technology (ICT)},   doi={10.1109/SASG.2017.8356507},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={Diagnosis, and monitoring of health is a very important task in healthcare industry. Due to time constraint, people are not visiting hospitals, which might and possibly lead to a lot of health issues in one instant of time. Predominantly most of the healthcare systems have been developed to predict and diagnose the health of the patients by which people who are busy in their schedule can also monitor their health at regular intervals. Many studies show that early prediction is the best way to cure health because early diagnosis will help and alert the patients to know the health status. Healthcare being a global issue more particularly India being a most populated nation where majority of which live in villages deprived of healthcare facilities on real time basis continuously and regularly. With the increasing use of technology, there is an urgent need to have such a smart health monitoring system that can communicate between network devices and application which will help the patients and doctors to monitor, track and record the patient's sensitive data containing medical information. This paper depicts the idea of solving health issues using the latest technology, Internet of Things (IoT). It presents the architectural review of smart healthcare system using Internet of Things(IoT) which is aimed to provide a Better HealthCare to everyone. Using this system architecture, patient's body parameters can be measured in real time. Sensors collect patients body parameters and transfers that data to Microcontroller ATMEL 89s52 which further transfer that data to the MySQL database server. This MySQL database server manages the data and provides accessibility. The patient can view this data with the help of Android App. Which one can install in Smartphone, or Tablet. If data is abnormal then patient gets notification also care takers will get emergency message. With the help of different decision making algorithms decisions can be made easily and fast and according to it people can have access to the database.

Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage.

Devices in IoT applications such as smart healthcare applications deal with sensitive data of our health and daily lives and thus can execute malicious actuating commands with serious safety consequences. Therefore, it is important to ensure secure communication channel establishment among the medical sensors or devices and the remote servers. In this work, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and suitable to protect sensitive health related data in the context of IoT. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic functions of resource-constrained sensors to the trustful neighboring sensors. This trust verification is ensured by finding the data correlations from the data of embedded accelerometers in the smartphone acting as gateway and the sensors installed on the body.

In case of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) that is based on the sensor network is usually deployed for single application. However, the future of WSNs based on sensors lies in the multiple application support and the aggregation of resources either in the form of hardware or software. To deal with the challenges of aggregation of sensors in the health care environment, virtualization of a sensor network is an evolving concept that enables aggregation of multiple independent heterogeneous sensor networks under one roof. In order to virtualize the sensors and networks, middleware layer role is the most dominant one. Furthermore, middleware for sensors poses the overhead challenges like processing time, memory utilization, sampling rate, delay, and power consumption. In this paper efforts have been put forward by proposing a middleware framework for sensor network that uses multi-threading technique that increases the sampling frequency and reduces the delay caused by the hardware abstraction layer that resides on top each sensor node. Mathematical model shows significant improvement in the processing time.},   keywords={ambient intelligence;Internet of Things;middleware;multi-threading;virtualisation;wireless sensor networks;multithreading technique;middleware;sensor network virtualization;wireless sensor network;WSN;Internet of Everything;IoE;ambient assisted living;AAL;Middleware;Virtualization;Wireless sensor networks;Delays;Logic gates;Hardware;Smart homes;Wireless Sensor Network (WSN);SHAAL;Virtual Sensor Networks (VSN);Middleware;sensor nodes},   doi={10.1109/NSITNSW.2015.7176421},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

Existing analytics are mostly hosted in cloud data centers, and may suffer from high latency, network congestion, and privacy issues. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a fog computing platform that runs analytics in a distributed way on multiple devices, including IoT devices, edge servers, and data-center servers. We focus on the core optimization problem: making deployment decisions to maximize the number of satisfied IoT analytics. We carefully formulate the deployment problem and design an efficient algorithm, named SSE, to solve it. Moreover, we conduct a detailed measurement study to derive system models of the IoT analytics based on diverse QoS levels and heterogeneous devices to facilitate the optimal deployment decisions. We implement a testbed to conduct experiments, which show that the system models achieve reasonably good accuracy. More importantly, 100% of the deployed IoT analytics satisfy the QoS targets. We also conduct extensive simulations for larger-scale scenarios. The simulation results reveal that our SSE algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm by up to 89.4% and 168.3% in terms of the number of satisfied IoT analytics and active devices.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={880-887},   abstract={With the need for increased care and welfare of the rapidly aging population, mobile telemedicine is becoming popular for providing remote health care to increase the quality of life. Recently, image analysis is being actively applied for medical diagnosis and treatment, in which image segmentation is of the fundamental importance for other image processing such as visualization and detection. However, given the tasks challenges in transmitting large volume of high-resolution images and the real-time constraints that are commonly present for mobile telemedicine, image segmentation is best done at the “edge”, i.e., locally so that only segmentation results are communicated. A powerful approach to medical image segmentation is cellular neural network (CeNN), which can achieve very high accuracy through proper training. However, CeNNs typically involve extensive computations in a recursive manner. As an example, to simply process an image of 1920×1080 pixels requires 4-8 Giga floating point multiplications (for 3×3 templates and 50-100 iterations), which needs to be done in a timely manner for real-time medical image segmentation. Such a demand is too high for most low power mobile computing platforms in IoTs, This paper presents a compressed CeNN framework for computation reduction in CeNNs, which is the first in the literature. It involves various techniques such as early exit and parameter quantization, which significantly reduces computation demands while maintaining an acceptable performance.},   keywords={cellular neural nets;edge detection;floating point arithmetic;health care;image segmentation;Internet of Things;medical image processing;mobile computing;telemedicine;rapidly aging population;mobile telemedicine;remote health care;image analysis;medical diagnosis;image processing;high-resolution images;real-time constraints;segmentation results;cellular neural network;real-time medical image segmentation;low power mobile computing platforms;compressed CeNN framework;edge segmentation;compressed cellular neural networks;4-8 Giga floating point multiplications},   doi={10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203873},   ISSN={1558-2434},   month={Nov},}

To accomplish this phenomenon, two varieties of security mechanism, cryptography and steganography is being applied. At the former stage, encryption is being provided to secret plain text using Vernam cipher (One-Time Pad) transposition technique, since Vernam cipher show good performance metrics in terms of less CPU running time, file size same after encryption and strong avalanche effect compare with all transposition cipher. And at the later stage, it transform cipher text into bytes and divides each byte into pairs of bits and assigns the decimal values to each pairs, which is known as master variable, master variable value range will be vary between 0 to 3. Depending upon the master patchy value, add that cipher text in the career image at Least Significant Bit (LSB) 6th and 7th bit location or 7th and 8th bit location or 7th and 6th or 8th and 7th bit location. Which shows the embedding location dynamicity of the algorithm depends upon dynamically changed master variable value. After completion of embedding and sending the stego image to the receiver side, retrieving process of the cipher text from the said locations will be done. And then decryption process to get the secret plain text back will be performed using the Vernam cipher transposition algorithms. In this we provide robust image steganography.

IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to the battlefield specific challenges such as the absence of communication infrastructure, and the susceptibility of devices to cyber and physical attacks.

The providers of IoT applications carefully design the devices and the applications and deploy the system in the field. Such applications are running on their own. However, due to the high cost of development and deployment of the IoT applications, there have been efforts to provide interoperability among different IoT applications. In this paper, we propose the concept of SNS of Things (SNSoT), which is a platform that acts as a SNS among the things in the Internet. Thus, all the data generated by the devices are considered as updates of the devices and the dissemination of the update is based on the social relationship among the devices. Our system, SNSoT, provides a framework in which the devices can create social neighbor relationships among the devices and exchange their data through the social networks. We carefully identify the necessary components of the framework and discuss the issues and challenges of SNSoT.},   keywords={Internet of Things;open systems;social networking (online);SNS of Things;globe scale interoperability;IoT applications;Internet of Things;SNSoT;social neighbor relationships;social networks;Real-time systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Interoperability;Social network services;Monitoring;Big data;XML},   doi={10.1109/ICUFN.2014.6876804},   ISSN={2165-8528},   month={July},}

Many children with autism are highly interested and motivated by smart devices such as computers and touch screen tablets. These types of assistive technology devices get children with autism to interact, make choices, respond, and tell parents what they are interested, need, think, and maybe even feel. Our proposed system uses JXTA-Overlay platform and Smart Box device to monitor the children and create P2P communication between children, caregivers and therapists. Various visual systems, such as objects, photographs, realistic drawings, line drawings, and written words, can be used with assorted modes of technology, as long as the child can readily comprehend the visual representation.

Its benefits are not limited to connecting things, but lean on how the collected data are transformed into insights and interact with domain experts for better decisions. Nonetheless, a set of challenges including the complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing big and heterogeneous data and as well as the system scalability need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems that drive the business decision-making. Consequently, inspired from the human nervous system and cognitive abilities, we have proposed a set of autonomic cognitive design patterns that alleviate the design complexity of smart IoT-based systems, while taking into consideration big data and scalability management. The ultimate goal of these patterns is providing generic and reusable solutions for elaborating flexible smart IoT-based systems able to perceive the collected data and provide decisions. These patterns are articulated within a model-driven methodology that we have proposed to incrementally refine the system functional and nonfunctional requirements. Following the proposed methodology, we have combined and instantiated a set of patterns for developing a flexible cognitive monitoring system to manage patients' health based on heterogeneous wearable devices. We have highlighted the gained flexibility and demonstrated the ability of our system to integrate and process heterogeneous large-scale data streams. Finally, we have evaluated the system performance in terms of response time and scalability management.},   keywords={Big Data;cognitive systems;fault tolerant computing;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;model-driven methodology;autonomic cognitive IoT-based systems;health care;Internet of Things;autonomic cognitive design patterns;smart IoT-based systems;Big Data;scalability management;system functional requirements;system nonfunctional requirements;cognitive monitoring system;patient health management;heterogeneous wearable devices;heterogeneous large-scale data stream integration;heterogeneous large-scale data stream processing;system performance evaluation;response time;Scalability;Monitoring;Big Data;Complexity theory;Complex systems;Computational modeling;Design methodology;Autonomic computing;big data;cognitive computing;design patterns;IoT-based system},   doi={10.1109/TETCI.2017.2699218},   ISSN={2471-285X},   month={June},}

In internet of vehicles, regular exchange of current position, direction, velocity and so on, enables mobile vehicles to predict an upcoming accident and alert the human drivers in time or proactively take precautionary actions to avoid the accident. The actualisation of this concept requires the use of channel access protocols that can guarantee reliable and timely broadcast of safety messages. This study investigates the application of network coding concept to increase content of every transmission and achieve improved broadcast reliability with less number of retransmissions. In particular, the authors proposed Code Aided Retransmission-based Error Recovery (CARER) scheme, introduced a request-to-broadcast/clear-to-broadcast (RTB/CTB) handshake to overcome hidden node problem and reduce packets collision rate. In order to avoid broadcast storm problem associated with the use of RTB/CTB packet in a broadcast transmission, they developed a rebroadcasting metric used to successfully select a vehicle to rebroadcast the encoded message. The performance of CARER protocol is clearly shown with detailed theoretical analysis and further validated with simulation experiments.},   keywords={network coding;road accidents;road traffic;telecommunication network reliability;vehicular ad hoc networks;packet collision rate;hidden node problem;RTB/CTB handshake;request-to-broadcast/clear-to-broadcast;CARER;code aided retransmission based error recovery;network coding concept;road accidents;reduce air pollution;relieve traffic congestion;transport safety;intelligent transportation systems;cross layer approach;road accidents prevention;timely packets delivery;reliable packets delivery;Internet of Vehicles},   doi={10.1049/iet-net.2015.0112},   ISSN={2047-4954},   month={},}

IoT allows many physical devices to capture transmit data, through the internet, providing more data interoperability methods. Nowadays IoT plays an important role not only in communication, but also in monitoring, recording, storage and display. Hence the latest trend in Healthcare communication method using IoT is adapted. Monitored on a continual basis, aggregated and effectively analyzed-such information can bring about a massive positive transformation in the field of healthcare. Our matter of concern in this project is to focus on the development and implementation of an effective healthcare monitoring system based on IoT. The proposed system monitors the vital health parameters and transmits the data through a wireless communication, which is further transferred to a network via a Wi-Fi module. The data can be accessed anytime promoting the reception of the current status of the patient. In case any abnormal behavior or any vital signs are recognized, the caretaker, as well as the doctors are notified immediately through a message service or an audio signaling device (buzzer). In order to design an efficient remote monitoring system, security plays an important part. Cloud computing and password protected Wi-Fi module handles authentication, privacy and security of patient details by allowing restricted access to the database.

Specifically, wearable technology and robotics can enable a user to collect the required human signals in a comfortable way. HealthIoT is the basic infrastructure for realizing health surveillance, and should be flexible to support multiple application demands and facilitate the management of infrastructure. Therefore, enlightened by the software defined network, we put forward a smart healthcare oriented control method to software define health monitoring in order to make the network more elastic. In this article, we design a centralized controller to manage physical devices and provide an interface for data collection, transmission, and processing to develop a more flexible health surveillance application that is full of personalization. With these distinguished characteristics, various applications can coexist in the shared infrastructure, and each application can demand that the controller customize its own data collection, transmission, and processing as required, and pass the specific configuration of the physical device. This article discusses the background, advantages, and design details of the architecture proposed, which is achieved by an open-ended question and a potential solution.

  year={2017},   volume={19},   number={4},   pages={2359-2391},   abstract={A novel paradigm that changes the scene for the modern communication and computation systems is the Edge Computing. It is not a coincidence that terms like Mobile Cloud Computing, Cloudlets, Fog Computing, and Mobile-Edge Computing are gaining popularity both in academia and industry. In this paper, we embrace all these terms under the umbrella concept of “Edge Computing” to name the trend where computational infrastructures hence the services themselves are getting closer to the end user. However, we observe that bringing computational infrastructures to the proximity of the user does not magically solve all technical challenges. Moreover, it creates complexities of its own when not carefully handled. In this paper, these challenges are discussed in depth and categorically analyzed. As a solution direction, we propose that another major trend in networking, namely software-defined networking (SDN), should be taken into account. SDN, which is not proposed specifically for Edge Computing, can in fact serve as an enabler to lower the complexity barriers involved and let the real potential of Edge Computing be achieved. To fully demonstrate our ideas, initially, we put forward a clear collaboration model for the SDN-Edge Computing interaction through practical architectures and show that SDN related mechanisms can feasibly operate within the Edge Computing infrastructures. Then, we provide a detailed survey of the approaches that comprise the Edge Computing domain. A comparative discussion elaborates on where these technologies meet as well as how they differ. Later, we discuss the capabilities of SDN and align them with the technical shortcomings of Edge Computing implementations. We thoroughly investigate the possible modes of operation and interaction between the aforementioned technologies in all directions and technically deduce a set of “Benefit Areas” which is discussed in detail. Lastly, as SDN is an evolving technology, we give the future directions for enhancing the SDN development so that it can take this collaboration to a further level.},   keywords={cloud computing;mobile computing;software defined networking;Fog Computing;Mobile-Edge Computing;computational infrastructures;SDN-Edge Computing interaction;computing benefit;modern communication;computation systems;Mobile Cloud Computing;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Servers;Complexity theory;Software defined networking;Computer architecture;Market research;Internet of Things;Wearable computing;Software-defined networking;edge computing;cloud computing;network virtualization;network management;service-centric network;Internet of Things;wearable computing},   doi={10.1109/COMST.2017.2717482},   ISSN={1553-877X},   month={Fourthquarter},}

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={16441-16458},   abstract={In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in Internet of Things (IoT) from centralized cloud computing to edge computing (or fog computing). Developments in ICT have resulted in the significant increment of communication and computation capabilities of embedded devices and this will continue to increase in coming years. However, existing paradigms do not utilize low-level devices for any decision-making process. In fact, gateway devices are also utilized mostly for communication interoperability and some low-level processing. In this paper, we have proposed a new computing paradigm, named Edge Mesh, which distributes the decision-making tasks among edge devices within the network instead of sending all the data to a centralized server. All the computation tasks and data are shared using a mesh network of edge devices and routers. Edge Mesh provides many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. These benefits are useful for critical applications, which require higher reliability, real-time processing, mobility support, and context awareness. We first give an overview of existing computing paradigms to establish the motivation behind Edge Mesh. Then, we describe in detail about the Edge Mesh computing paradigm, including the proposed software framework, research challenges, and benefits of Edge Mesh. We have also described the task management framework and done a preliminary study on task allocation problem in Edge Mesh.

Traditional lifelogging PA monitoring is conducted in non-naturalistic settings by means of wearable devices or mobile phones such as fixed placements, controlled durations or dedicated sensors. Although they achieved satisfactory outcomes for healthcare studies, the practicability become the key issues. Recent advance of mobile devices make lifelogging PA tracking for healthy or unhealthy individuals possible. However, owning to diverse physical characteristics, immaturity of PA recognition techniques, different settings from manufactories and a majority of uncertainties in real life, the results of PA measurement is leading to be inapplicable for PA pattern detection in a long range, especially hardly exploited in the wellbeing monitoring or behaviour changes. This paper investigates and compares uncertainties of existing mobile devices for individual's PA tracking. Irregular uncertainties (IU) are firstly removed by exploiting Ellipse fitting model, and then monthly density maps that contain regular uncertainties (RU) are constructed based on metabolic equivalents (METs) of different activity types. Five months of four subjects PA intensity changes using the mobile app tracker Moves [1] and Google Fit app on wearable device Samsung wear S2 are carried out from a mobile personalised healthcare platform MHA [2]. The result indicates that uncertainty of PA intensity monitored by mobile phone is 90% lower than wearable device, where the datasets tend to be further explored by healthcare/fitness studies.

However, increasing use of the IoT services in E-health applications has led to increase the concerns of security and privacy, especially in healthcare domain. In fact, healthcare applications are prone to data breaches and widening issues in security aspects owing to increasing number of access points to sensitive data through electronic medical records, as well as the rising popularity of wearable technology. For example, of these issues, authentication of the different connected entities, energy efficiency and exchanged data confidentiality form the major concerns for users. Therefore, the successful deployment of IoT-based E-health application rely on overcome the major security concerns for the users which needs to be addressed in energy efficient way. Though a number of researches have conducted for lightweight secure authentication, there is still a great room for further research to address security challenges as well as its energy efficiency for those security authentication schemes in IoT. There is a great need to design and develop a lightweight secure authentication model, which offers significant security level against multiple attacks such as mainly: Impersonation attacks, man in the middle attack and unknown key sharing attacks for IoT base E-health domain. This research proposed a secure group-based lightweight authentication scheme for IoT based E-health applications, the proposed model will provide mutual authentication and energy efficient, and computation for healthcare IoT based applications. Which will use elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) principles that provide mentioned featured of suggested model.},   keywords={Secure;Authentication;Light weight;ECC;IoT},   doi={10.23919/ICACT.2018.8323801},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

 title={PhD Forum: Multimodal IoT and EMR Based Smart Health Application for Asthma Management in Children}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-2},   abstract={According to a study done in 2014 by National Health Interview Survey around 6.3 million children in United States suffer from asthma [1]. Asthma remains one of the leading reasons for pediatric admissions to children's hospitals, and has a prevalence rate of approximately 10% in children and it leads to missed days from school and other societal costs. This occurs despite improved medications to control asthma symptoms. Asthma management is challenging as it involves understanding asthma causes and avoiding asthma triggers that are both multi- factorial and individualistic in nature. It is almost impossible for doctors to constantly monitor each patient's health and environmental triggers. According to a recent article, the IoT device market in health-care will increase to a worth of $117 billion by the year 2020 [2]. The monitoring segment of IoT devices have predicted to increase $15 billion in 2017 [5]. The sales of smart watches, fitness and health trackers, are expected to account for more than 70% of all wearables sale worldwide in 2016 [6]. According to IBM, the volume of health-care data has reached to 150 exabytes in 2017 [7]. The data generated from these consumer graded devices is increasing day by day. This data collection has exacerbated the problem of understanding the data and making sense of it. We can use these low-cost sensors and consumer graded devices for continuous monitoring and management of asthma patients. We developed kHealth&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a framework for continuous monitoring of the patient's personal, public and population-based health signals and send alerts to the patient when a condition deserves patient's or clinician's attention. This can assist the clinician in determining the triggers and deciding the future course of action for prevention and treatment of the disease. More importantly, it can also help a patient to better take control of his/her health management by taking more timely actions(e.g., in case of asthma, using an inhaler in a more timely manner to ward off an attack). Our kHealth framework goes well beyond the efforts of data collection and focuses on contextual and personalized processing of multi-modal data to help understand asthma control level and vulnerability score (change in conditions that increases the chances of an adverse event, thus requiring proactive action). Another unique aspect of our research is close collaboration with clinician combined with on-going evaluation of clinician's at the Dayton Children's hospital which involves an ongoing trial of our novel technical approach with a cohort of 200 patients.},   keywords={diseases;electronic health records;Internet of Things;mobile computing;paediatrics;patient monitoring;electronic medical records;vulnerability score;asthma control level;multimodal data processing;kHealth framework;continuous patient monitoring;children;asthma management;smart health application;EMR;multimodal IoT;Pediatrics;Air quality;Temperature measurement;Medical services;Monitoring;Sensors;Humidity},   doi={10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2017.7947025},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobile computing;social networking (online);social sciences computing;social persuasion;online network;physical network;interpersonal trust;data-driven analysis;Internet of Things;big data;smartphone;cyber world;Market research;Social network services;Media;Context modeling;Internet;Global Positioning System;Public policy;Design methodology;Algorithm design and analysis;Internet of things;Complex networks;Medical services;Social factors;Behavioral science;Cyber–physical social networks;networked intervention;persuasive computing;social persuasion;Cyber–physical social networks;networked intervention;persuasive computing;social persuasion},   doi={10.1109/JPROC.2014.2363986},   ISSN={0018-9219},   month={Dec},}

Exploiting the advantages of Fog computing for anomaly detection provides the ability to detect abnormal patterns in an accurate and timely manner. Use of Centralized and Distributed anomaly detection methods suffer from significant latency and energy consumption issues.

In some IoT use cases, power can be supplied to sensors by way of renewable energy automatic harvesting (solar panels, etc.). Given the high variability of energy arrival processes, energy consumption in sensors, in particular caused by transmissions to the sink, has to be aligned with energy harvesting patterns, so as to maximize throughput while avoiding power outages that may arise when the battery is empty. This paper proposes ODMAC++, an extension to a well-known protocol for sensor transmission scheduling in a WSN. ODMAC++ relies on learning techniques to adapt sensors communication rate to energy harvesting patterns, and uses a beaconing mechanism whose frequency is adjusted based on past measurements on the harvested energy process.

The real-time data is then transmitted to a remote cloud server for real-time processing, visualization, and diagnosis. In this paper, we enhance such a health monitoring system by exploiting the concept of fog computing at smart gateways providing advanced techniques and services such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification service at the edge of network. Particularly, we choose Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction as the case study as it plays an important role in diagnosis of many cardiac diseases. ECG signals are analyzed in smart gateways with features extracted including heart rate, P wave and T wave via a flexible template based on a lightweight wavelet transform mechanism.

These devices, often referred to as smart items or intelligent things can be home appliances, healthcare devices, vehicles, buildings, factories and almost anything networked and fitted with sensors, actuators, embedded computers. There has been sustained research work and standardization effort from different IoT perspectives like integration of sensor and RFID devices to the Internet. With the increasing trend of gathering business insights from unstructured data, the high volume of data generated by such devices is also of interest. Cloud based data mining platforms are suitable for analyses of such data and researchers have proposed architectures where personal mobile phones can act as Edge Gateway between the sensor network and cloud analytics platform. It seems that the surge in the volume of data generated by huge number of Smart Items can only be matched if a large percentage of mobile users start sharing the computation capability of their personal devices and work together towards true Participatory Computing in the IoT systems. In this work we try to understand the challenges associated with running computation jobs on the mobile devices using different types of workload often observed in IoT applications. Based on the insights gained from experiments performed by us, we propose a scheme where mobile phones, residential gateways and other edge devices offer free slots to servers in a cloud based data analytics system. Based on the free time slots offered by the mobile phones, if commensurately sized computational jobs can be scheduled, the unpredictability associated with using mobile phones as grid resources can be solved.},   keywords={cloud computing;data mining;embedded systems;Internet of Things;mobile computing;mobile handsets;edge devices;IoT computation grids;Internet of things;technology revolution;smart items;intelligent things;home appliances;healthcare devices;vehicles;buildings;factories;sensors;actuators;embedded computers;RFID devices;business insights;unstructured data;cloud based data mining platforms;personal mobile phones;edge gateway;sensor network;cloud analytics platform;mobile users;participatory computing;residential gateways;mobile phones;grid resources;Servers;Smart phones;Mobile communication;Availability;Sensors;Internet;cyber-physical;ubiquitous systems;analytics;internet of things;iot;prediction;mobile grid},   doi={10.1109/ICPADS.2013.101},   ISSN={1521-9097},   month={Dec},}

In the healthcare environment, the use of IoT technologies brings convenience to physicians and patients as they can be applied to various medical areas (such as constant real-time monitoring, patient information management, medical emergency management, blood information management, and health management). The radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT deployments in the healthcare environment. To satisfy the various security requirements of RFID technology in IoT, many RFID authentication schemes have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication schemes have attracted a lot of attention and have been used in the healthcare environment. In this paper, we discuss the security requirements of RFID authentication schemes, and in particular, we present a review of ECC-based RFID authentication schemes in terms of performance and security. Although most of them cannot satisfy all security requirements and have satisfactory performance, we found that there are three recently proposed ECC-based authentication schemes suitable for the healthcare environment in terms of their performance and security.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;public key cryptography;radiofrequency identification;Internet of Things;healthcare environment;elliptic curve cryptography;IoT technologies;radio-frequency identification technology;security requirements;ECC-based RFID authentication schemes;Radiofrequency identification;Authentication;Medical devices;Medical services;Internet of Things;Biomedical monitoring;Intelligent ;Elliptic curve cryptography;Cryptography;Radiofrequency identification;Computer security;Authentication;Elliptic curve cryptography;Internet of Things;Performance;Radio Frequency indentification;Security;Authentication;elliptic curve cryptography (ECC);Internet of Things (IoT);performance;radio-frequency identification (RFID);security},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2360121},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Recently, an accelerating number of studies are dedicated to deploying various IoT applications in the information centric network paradigm which has lower system complexity than traditional network architectures. However, such a paradigm poses a number of security challenges especially when it is applied in real-time e-health applications. Firstly, it is difficult to ensure security of sensitive data in such a distributed data caching environment because after the data is published in the form of a packet to the information centric network (ICN), it is no longer controlled by the data publisher. Secondly, in some real-time e-health applications, terminal medical sensors are usually resource-constrained, limiting the direct adoption of expensive cryptographic primitives. In order to address these challenges, a resource-efficient secure data sharing scheme in information centric e-health system is proposed, one that utilizes ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and adapts it to the above-mentioned system with respect to necessary security requirements. It also exploits computation resources of fog nodes and employs outsourcing cryptography to improve system efficiency.The evaluation demonstrates that the scheme can significantly reduce the computation overheads of the resource-constrained terminal medical devices, and can better support the real-time e-health applications.},   keywords={cache storage;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;outsourcing;resource-efficient secure data;information centric e-health system;fog computing;accelerating number;IoT applications;information centric network paradigm;lower system complexity;security challenges;real-time e-health applications;sensitive data;distributed data caching environment;data publisher;above-mentioned system;computation resources;system efficiency;resource-constrained terminal medical devices;network architectures;security requirements;Encryption;Real-time systems;Task analysis;Edge computing;Publish-subscribe},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422844},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

The “smart home” is one of the most popular topics in the IoT research. We consider that the scale of an IoT-oriented smart home system can go up at the aspects of residential, community and society. Resource allocation and distribution among devices, platforms and services become crucial to system reliability and performance, thus being worth of research efforts in smart home scenarios with IoT support. In this paper, we propose a reference architecture in pursuit of an IoT-based smart home system. Particularly, the home care scenario is deployed to exhibit the scenario on the proposed architecture. Our architecture reference is across front-end to back-end roles in this context, where the home gateway plays the most important role. Accordingly, we design a comprehensive functional home gateway (CFHG) which integrates combined functions of different application strategies on the middleware platform. All data in front-end sensor devices can be aggregated to gateway devices and distributed to cloud storage via web services at the back-end devices, and vice versa, control and management instructions can be issued to any indicated devices to regulate data processing operations. Finally, we make our architecture into effect with practical implementation, and present several usages regarding home care applications.},   keywords={Internet of Things;middleware;resource allocation;Web services;architecture reference;back-end roles;comprehensive functional home gateway;front-end sensor devices;gateway devices;back-end devices;home care applications;IoT support;IoT research;smart home system;society;system reliability;smart home scenarios;reference architecture;home care scenario;Logic gates;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Smart homes;Servers;Home care;Smart home;Comprehensive functionality;Web service;Cloud service;IoT},   doi={10.1109/UMEDIA.2017.8074155},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

We present a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},   keywords={inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;meta data;ubiquitous computing;visual programming;Internet of Things;ubiquitous computing;smart environment;service composition system;goal-driven configuration;semantic metadata;reasoning;visual modeling tool;process-driven approach;service mashups;embedded semantic API descriptions;application program interfaces;smart homes;Semantics;Mashups;Visualization;Manufacturing;Internet of things;Protocols;Context;Internet of Things;semantic technologies;service composition;smart factory;smart home;web of things},   doi={10.1109/TASE.2016.2533321},   ISSN={1545-5955},   month={July},}

The need is due to increased ICT use and the potentials for positive treatment outcomes from informed decision-making. A challenge is security of sensitive data, however detailing this is beyond the scope of this paper. In line with this need, an evolving cloud-based collaboration infrastructure resource is reported where global networks of professional subscribers will have increasing access to specific profile data and recommendation strategies. The focus on this phase of the work is to network those using (or considering using) ICT in wellness/QOL, rehabilitation and habilitation. The resource is being built from real-world case studies and is envisioned as a developing “feed-in feed-out” entity where evidence-based findings are submitted and extracted via a secured `gateway' by expert professional practitioners. The resource is considered an `Internet of Things' model to also inform and consult families of people diagnosed with impairments or patients undergoing treatment. Recommended intervention apparatus include bespoke/custom systems as well as commercially available systems. `In-action' and `On-action' models for have emerged from the research. This means that therapists adopting ICT into their work have a wealth of prior studies to guide their choices of hardware, software and intervention method and analysis without having to wade through academic or scientific articles, papers and book chapters.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={The last decade has witnessed tremendous efforts to shape the internet of thing (IoT) platforms to be well suited for healthcare applications. These applications involve the deployment of remote monitoring platforms to collect different information about several vital signs such as electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the deployment of these platforms faces several limitations in terms of high power consumption and system complexity. High energy consumption associated with the continuous wireless data transmission can be optimized by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well chosen sensing matrices to take random projections of the data in sub-Nyquist sampling rates. In addition, system complexity can be reduced by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of CS-based scheme for vital sign acquisition for a connected health application over an IoT platform taking multi-channel EEG signals as a case study. In addition, the paper exploits the joint sparsity of multi-channel EEG signals as well as a designed sparsifying basis to increase the sparsity of the EEG signal to improve the reconstruction quality, hence, increase the efficiency of the system.},   keywords={compressed sensing;data acquisition;electroencephalography;health care;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;joint sparsity recovery;compressive sensing;healthcare applications;remote monitoring platforms;system complexity;continuous wireless data transmission;CS;emerging theory;compressed acquisition;hardware friendly structured sensing matrices;vital sign acquisition;connected health application;IoT platform;multichannel EEG signals;power consumption;sensing matrices;subNyquist sampling rates;electroencephalogram;energy consumption;reconstruction quality improvement;Electroencephalography;Sensors;Matching pursuit algorithms;Image coding;Compressed sensing;Wireless communication;Brain modeling;Internet of things (IoT);EEG;compressive sensing (CS);joint sparsity},   doi={10.1109/ICUWB.2017.8251001},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

For the IoT connected healthcare applications, the wireless body area network (WBAN) is gaining popularity as wearable devices spring into the market. This paper proposes a wearable sensor node with solar energy harvesting and Bluetooth low energy transmission that enables the implementation of an autonomous WBAN. Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject's body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.},   keywords={Bluetooth;body area networks;computerised monitoring;energy harvesting;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;patient monitoring;wireless sensor networks;continuous medical monitoring;output-based maximum power point tracking technique;flexible solar energy harvester;Web-based smartphone application;autonomous WBAN;Bluetooth low energy transmission;solar energy harvesting;wearable sensor node;IoT connected healthcare applications;Internet of Things;autonomous wireless body area network;time 24 h;Wearable sensors;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Solar panels;Solar energy;Maximum power point trackers;Temperature measurement;Internet of Things;wireless body area network;energy harvesting;maximum power point tracking;Bluetooth},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2716344},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

These are biggest service industries that affect whole world population and give jobs to millions of people. Recently we witness major changes in both industries, as more services are transferred to small providers, including individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. This process is driven by huge growth in demand, which cannot be fulfilled by applying traditional solutions. The new generation of digital services reshapes landscape of both industries. Some players see it as a threat, as digital services replace their traditional business models. But fighting against progress is useless, especially when you cannot fulfill growing by old means. Internet of Things (IoT) is an integral part of the Future Internet ecosystem that will have major impact on development of healthcare and e-Tourism services. IoT provides an infrastructure to uniquely identify and link physical objects to their virtual representations in Internet. As a result any physical object can have virtual reflection in the service space. This gives an opportunity to replace actions on physical objects by operations on their virtual reflections, which can be done much faster, cheaper and more comfortable for people. This provides a huge space for developing and applying new business models.

However, when traveling with buses, the travelers not only care about the waiting time, but also care about the crowdedness in the bus itself. Excessively overcrowded bus may drive away the anxious travelers and make them reluctant to take buses. So accurate, real-time and reliable passenger demand prediction becomes necessary, which can help determine the bus headway and reduce the waiting time of passengers. However, there are three major challenges for predicting the passenger demand on bus services: inhomogeneous, seasonal bursty periods and periodicities. To overcome the challenges, we propose three predictive models and further take a data stream ensemble framework to predict the number of passengers. We develop an experiment over a 22-week period. The evaluation results suggest that the proposed method achieves outstanding prediction accuracy among 86,411 passenger demands on bus services, more than 78% of them are accurately forecasted.},   keywords={public transport;road vehicles;passenger demand prediction;bus service;public transport;bus transport;fuel consumption;traffic congestion;Predictive models;Roads;Vehicles;Time series analysis;Clustering algorithms;Mathematical model;Real-time systems;us transport;traffic congestion;passenger demand prediction;predictive modelsus transport;traffic congestion;passenger demand prediction;predictive modelsb},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380692},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={132-137},   abstract={The rapid advances in modern wireless technology opens the door for new applications using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In the medical field, staff members of a certain hospital are in need for a system that tracks where patients/medical staff/devices are at any given time. LoCATE, which is Localization of Health Center Assets Through an IoT Environment, provides a near-real time tracking tool for medical systems using the existing 802.11 WiFi infrastructure. The primary goal of this system is to track assets and personnel at any hospital (e.g., Sentara<sup>®</sup>RMH hospital) and continuously log a real-time location data on a cloud computing platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using LoCATE, administrators can view the location of doctors, patients, and assets in real-time via a web UI or a mobile app, within the organization. The collected data, stored and processes on a Cloud Storage platform, is then analyzed to expose inefficiencies in daily operations and improve the health care system. Low-level functionality of the LoCATE system is unlike that of typical Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies. The spirit of the IoT paradigm employed by LoCATE makes the system both flexible and scalable, by leveraging collaboration between embedded and cloud systems. This flexibility will allow for the future support of additional applications such as hardware integration (e.g., New hardware components). This can include data acquisition such as usage statistics and historical patient health data. Compiling this data might pave the way for future research into disease vectors or could be used to optimize care delivered for specific conditions.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={396-401},   abstract={The Internet of Things promises to enable numerous future applications spanning many domains, including health care, and is comprised of devices that are constrained in terms of computational and energy resources. A specific health care application is to ascertain patients' activity of daily living while at home using accelerometer data from non-invasive wearables. It is often necessary to store this data on the device to be retrieved later for analysis. However, the devices typically store far more data than can be transmitted with commonly used low power radios. To mitigate the problem, this paper proposes an energy efficient, lossless compression algorithm that uses an offline frequency distribution to create a symbol-code lookup table. Using an extensive set of data from a previous study, an analysis of the entropy of activities of daily living accelerometer data is presented. The compression algorithm is compared against this estimated entropy. Energy being critical for IoT devices, the trade-off between energy cost for compression versus energy saved during transmission is also analysed.},   keywords={accelerometers;data compression;entropy;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;table lookup;noninvasive wearables;symbol-code lookup table;IoT devices;energy analysis;Internet of Things;numerous future applications;frequency distribution;health care application;computational resourses;patients activity;power radios;energy efficiency;entropy analysis;energy transmission;accelerometer lossless compression algorithm;Entropy;Accelerometers;Conferences;Medical services;Compression algorithms;Biomedical monitoring;Dictionaries},   doi={10.1109/WCNCW.2018.8368985},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={523-530},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is an ubiquitous concept where physical objects are connected over the internet and are provided with unique identifiers to enable their self-identification to other devices and the ability to transmit data over the network. Sensor nodes along with their heterogeneous nature are the main part of the IoT and may act as internet hosts or clients. Communication security and end-users privacy protection is a major concern in the development of IoT especially if these IP-enabled sensor nodes have limited resources. Secret key distribution for heterogeneous sensors becomes challenging due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives and computational resources as in Healthcare applications. This paper introduces a new End-to-End key establishment protocol that is lightweight for resource-constrained sensors and secure through strong encryption and authentication. By using this protocol, resource-constrained nodes can also benefit from the same security functionalities that are typical of unconstrained domains, without however having to execute computationally intensive operations. The protocol is based on cooperation by offloading the heavy cryptographic operations of constrained nodes to the neighboring trusted nodes or devices. Security analysis and performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol is secure and is sufficiently energy efficient.},   keywords={biosensors;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;message authentication;private key cryptography;secure end-to-end key establishment protocol;resource-constrained healthcare sensors;IoT context;Internet of Things;physical objects;Internet connection;Internet hosts;Internet clients;communication security;end-users privacy protection;IP-enabled sensor nodes;secret key distribution;heterogeneous sensors;cryptographic primitives;healthcare applications;strong encryption;authentication;resource-constrained nodes;computationally intensive operations;security analysis;performance evaluation;energy efficiency;Decision support systems;Internet of Things (IoT);Security;Key Management;Healthcare;Resource-constrained;Authentication},   doi={10.1109/HPCSim.2016.7568379},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

One of the established applications of WSN is localization of moving objects, which is integral part of monitoring, surveillance, intrusion detection and target tracking. For localizing a moving object in WSNs, generally, a set of location-aware static WSN nodes are used to localize the mobile nodes or moving target using a specific localization algorithm. RSSI and Trilateration based location identification is a well-known traditional method which needs distance calculation prior to localization. Many researchers have modified the traditional trilateration method to better suit their application or in general. In this paper we present, a modified trilateration method, which uses our application specific cooperative technique with better choice of beacon node placement to improve distance calculation method. The distance values are then used to expedite the trilateration process. The proposed technique has been simulated and compared with the traditional method.

State-of-the-art algorithms suffer from two issues: computation intensive features and large internal memory requirement, which make them inapplicable for constrained devices. We reduce the memory requirement of our algorithm by reducing the size of data segments (i.e. the window of input stream data on which the processing is performed), and the number of required EEG channels. To respect the limitations of the processing capability, we reduce the complexity of our exploited features by only considering the simple features, which also contributes to reducing the memory requirements. Then, we provide new relevant features to compensate the information loss due to the simplifications (i.e. less number of channels, simpler features, shorter segment, etc.). We measured the energy consumption (12.41 mJ) and execution time (565 ms) for processing each segment (i.e. 5.12 seconds of EEG data) on a low-power MSP432 device.

Traffic sensor data gathered by large amounts of sensors show some new features, such as massiveness, continuity, streaming, and spatio-temporality. ITS applications utilizing traffic sensor data can be divided into three main types: 1) offline processing of historical data; 2) online processing of streaming data; and 3) hybrid processing of both. Current research tends to solve these problems in separate solutions, such as stream computing and batch processing. In this paper, we propose a hybrid processing approach and present corresponding system implementation for both streaming and historical traffic sensor data, which combines spatio-temporal data partitioning, pipelined parallel processing, and stream computing techniques to support hybrid processing of traffic sensor data in real-time.

A need-based HMM-IOT hybrid has been used for the smart hospital scheme proposed here, and it continuously synchronizes itself with the current spectral analysis data of the bio-signals of the admitted patients acquired by non-invasive processes like Electroencephalogram, Electromyogram, Electrocardiogram etc. The results of the experimentation are really promising.},   keywords={hidden Markov models;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical information systems;probability;HMM-IOT hybrid;current spectral analysis data;hidden Markov model;predictive analysis;dynamic probabilistic nature;Internet of Things;hybrid driven smart hospital;Hospital Information System;Hidden Markov models;Hospitals;Electromyography;Internet of Things;Electroencephalography;Synchronization;Hidden Markov Models;Internet of Things;Hospital Information System;Smart hospitals;Spectral Analysis},   doi={10.1109/ICCCNT.2017.8204069},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

There have been distinctive health challenges focused in the society through technical innovations. Most of the elderly people today experiences loneliness and psychological depressions, either as a result of living alone/ abandonment or due to reduced connection with their children and relatives. To enhance the quality of services in the elderly healthcare system we have developed a ubiquitous intuitive IoT-based (Internet of Things) Help to You (H2U) healthcare system to integrate various technologies of wearable devices, biosensors and wireless sensor networks in order to provide an intensive service management platform. This method would support the real time activity and monitor the healthcare system for the elderly citizens. In this method the information collected by various wearable devices in real time are stored in the central database which thereby connects people, doctors, and practitioner at the time of an emergency for the right information.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Crowdsensing is, for a few years, a hot topic. Until now, research on crowdsensing mainly focused on scenarios with devices such as smartphones with huge memory and high computive skills. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), crowdsensing can be envisaged with other constraints. Indeed, some IoT nodes are mobile but with limitations about storage and processing capabilities, then connectivity disruptions might occur between the nodes. These issues are tackled by a Disruption Tolerant Networking architecture. In this article, we focus on a subset of IoT, Mobile Sensing Networks (MSN). We propose then, a mechanism which respects the constraints of the nodes and maintains high performance. This mechanism, the multi-level FREAK, uses the mean frequency of contacts with the destination. The metrics drives the transmission. Since some nodes might not meet the destination nor nodes meeting the destination, we had the idea of a multi-level metrics to allow these “disconnected” nodes to transmit data to the destination. We evaluate our proposal through simulations based on several real mobility traces. Our solution outperforms reference replication and quota-based DTN solutions.},   keywords={data communication;delay tolerant networks;Internet of Things;mobile computing;sensor fusion;smart phones;multilevel FREAK DTN;disconnected nodes;crowdsensing;smartphones;Internet of Things;mobile IoT nodes;processing capabilities;storage capabilities;disruption tolerant networking architecture;mobile sensing networks;MSN;multilevel metrics;quota-based DTN solutions;Internet of Things;Disruption Tolerant Networking;Opportunistic network;Data transmission},   doi={10.1109/NOF.2016.7810111},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

Medical devices in healthcare IoT measure patients' vital signs and aggregate these data into medical files which are uploaded to the cloud for storage and accessed by healthcare workers. To protect patients' privacy, encryption is normally used to enforce access control of medical files by authorized parties while preventing unauthorized access. In healthcare, it is crucial to enable timely access of patient files in emergency situations. In this paper, we propose a lightweight break-glass access control (LiBAC) system that supports two ways for accessing encrypted medical files: attribute-based access and break-glass access. In normal situations, a medical worker with an attribute set satisfying the access policy of a medical file can decrypt and access the data. In emergent situations, the break-glass access mechanism bypasses the access policy of the medical file to allow timely access to the data by emergency medical care or rescue workers. LiBAC is lightweight since very few calculations are executed by devices in the healthcare IoT network, and the storage and transmission overheads are low. LiBAC is formally proved secure in the standard model and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its efficiency.},   keywords={authorisation;cryptography;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient care;medical file;timely access;emergency medical care;healthcare IoT network;lightweight break-glass access control system;patient care;medical devices;healthcare IoT measure patients;healthcare workers;unauthorized access;patient files;emergency situations;medical worker;access policy;emergent situations;break-glass access mechanism;healthcare Internet-of-Things;Access control;Medical services;Cryptography;Biomedical imaging;Informatics;Hip;Cloud computing;Access control;break-glass;healthcare system;lightweight;secure Internet-of-Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/TII.2017.2751640},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={Aug},}

We propose a new approach to shared key derivation for Body Area Networks (BANs). Body area networks are quickly becoming increasingly important in the world of healthcare with wide application in the treatment and monitoring of chronic patients using on-body devices. Advancements in the field will result in quicker response times in emergency situations, and detect complications in patients at a much earlier stage potentially saving many lives. In this paper, we have used motion sensors instead of the more common physiological signals that need physical access to the body, like electrocardiograms (ECG), to pair devices and secure communication in Body Area Networks. Our method considers the acceleration of the devices that needs to communicate. These measurements tend to be similar as devices are deployed on the same host body, which means that these could be used to derive shared keys. We show that these measurements results in derived keys that are unpredictable and exhibit significant difference with previous keys. This is an improvement over existing schemes where keys vary for different hosts but tend to be similar over time.},   keywords={ad hoc networks;body area networks;body sensor networks;cryptography;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;motion measurement;patient monitoring;patient treatment;telecommunication security;telemedicine;wearable security;body area sensor network;host movement;Internet-of-Things;ad-hoc connections;security parameter negotiation;shared key derivation;BAN;healthcare;chronic patient treatment;chronic patient monitoring;on-body devices;response time;emergency situation;patient complication detection;motion sensors;physiological signals;physical access;electrocardiograms;ECG;secure communication;device communication;Feature extraction;Cryptography;Monitoring;Body area networks;Frequency measurement;Biomedical monitoring;Authentication;Key Derivation;Physiology;Internet-of-Things;User-Centric;Security},   doi={10.1109/ISIE.2016.7745050},   ISSN={2163-5145},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Future Internet of Things (IoT) networks are expected to support a massive number of heterogeneous devices/sensors in diverse applications ranging from eHealthcare to industrial control systems. In highly-dense deployment scenarios such as industrial IoT systems, providing reliable communication links with low-latency becomes challenging due to the involved system delay including data acquisition and processing latencies at the edge-side of IoT networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a priority-based channel access and data aggregation scheme at the Cluster Head (CH) to reduce channel access and queuing delays in a clustered industrial IoT network. First, a prioritized channel access mechanism is developed by assigning different Medium Access Control (MAC) layer attributes to the packets coming from two types of IoT nodes, namely, high-priority and low-priority nodes, based on the application-specific information provided from the cloud-center. Subsequently, a preemptive M/G/1 queuing model is employed by using separate low-priority and high- priority queues before sending aggregated data to the Cloud. Our results show that the proposed priority-based method significantly improves the system latency and reliability as compared to the non-prioritized scheme.},   keywords={access protocols;cellular radio;channel allocation;data acquisition;data aggregation;industrial control;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;queueing theory;wireless IoT;data aggregation;diverse applications;industrial control systems;highly-dense deployment scenarios;industrial IoT systems;reliable communication links;involved system delay including data acquisition;processing latencies;IoT networks;Cluster Head;queuing delays;clustered industrial IoT network;prioritized channel access mechanism;IoT nodes;low-priority nodes;application-specific information;preemptive M/G/1 queuing model;high- priority queues;aggregated data;Future Internet of Things networks;heterogeneous devices;Medium Access Control layer;Delays;Data aggregation;Media Access Protocol;Logic gates;Reliability;Data models;Cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8255038},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={Communication Complexity of Dual Decomposition Methods for Distributed Resource Allocation Optimization}, 
  year={2018},   volume={12},   number={4},   pages={717-732},   abstract={Dual decomposition methods are among the most prominent approaches for finding primal/dual saddle point solutions of resource allocation optimization problems. To deploy these methods in the emerging Internet of things networks, which will often have limited data rates, it is important to understand the communication overhead they require. Motivated by this, we introduce and explore two measures of communication complexity of dual decomposition methods to identify the most efficient communication among these algorithms. The first measure is €-complexity, which quantifies the minimal number of bits needed to find an €-accurate solution. The second measure is b-complexity, which quantifies the best possible solution accuracy that can be achieved from communicating b bits. We find the exact €and b-complexity of a class of resource allocation problems where a single supplier allocates resources to multiple users. For both the primal and dual problems, the €-complexity grows proportionally to log2 (1/€) and the b-complexity proportionally to 1/2<sup>b</sup>. We also introduce a variant of the €- and b-complexity measures where only algorithms that ensure primal feasibility of the iterates are allowed. Such algorithms are often desirable because overuse of the resources can overload the respective systems, e.g., by causing blackouts in power systems. We provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate of these primal feasible complexity measures. In particular, we show that the b-complexity cannot converge at a faster rate than O(1/b). Therefore, the results demonstrate a tradeoff between fast convergence and primal feasibility. We illustrate the result by numerical studies.},   keywords={communication complexity;convergence;Internet of Things;optimisation;resource allocation;€-complexity;b-complexity measures;primal feasible complexity measures;communication complexity;dual decomposition methods;distributed resource allocation optimization;primal/dual saddle point solutions;resource allocation optimization problems;communication overhead;convergence rate;Internet of Things networks;Complexity theory;Resource management;Signal processing algorithms;Optimization;Bandwidth;Convergence;Communication networks;Distributed optimization;networked systems;resource allocation;communication complexity},   doi={10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2848718},   ISSN={1932-4553},   month={Aug},}

In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable "things" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which "things" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).},   keywords={data structures;ecology;embedded systems;emergency services;health care;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;health hazards anticipation;ontology-based IoT domotic environment;embedded intelligence;Internet of Things;ambient intelligence;digital traces;intelligent things;human behavior;everyday life;automated home;Internet-capable things;semantic knowledge representation;semantic Web;distributed environmental context information;natural abstraction;interoperability;technology-independent manner;domestic environment;computational significance;intelligent ecosystem;machine learning;artificial intelligence techniques;occupants behaviors;e-health system;emergency situations;Ontologies;Semantics;Ambient intelligence;Context;Senior citizens;Monitoring;Ambient Intelligent;domotics;home automation;DomoNet;SOA;XML;Ontology;Machine Learning;E-Health},   doi={10.1109/IMIS.2012.109},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

But massive deployment comes with severe security concerns. IoT devices are capable of running operating systems within themselves. An adversary may tamper or clone these IoT devices for his or her benefit. Most of the modern operating systems today use attack prevention techniques based on No-eXecute (NX) memory page protection scheme, which prevents execution of malicious code injected into the device. But, Return Oriented Programming (ROP) has the capability to break this security cover and take control over the IoT device. In this paper we present an effective implementation of the ROP, used as a defensive weapon against code tampering by adversaries.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={The challenges related to the large-scale deployment of the Internet of Things to enable a wide range of application use cases have received significant attention. A number of communication technologies have been and are still developed ranging from evolved existing technologies such as 4G, WiFi or WPAN technologies to the much hyped 5G networks. Against the background of the on-going discussion on the most suitable technologies the Bluetooth Special Interest Group has proposed the next generation Bluetooth 5 specification and claims to be ready for the Internet of Things as well: mainly by increasing the maximum communication range and adapting the corresponding data rates. In this context, this paper evaluates the suitability of Bluetooth 5 for realistic application activity levels and interference scenarios, based on analytical models and validated by frequency hopping algorithm simulations. The performance results demonstrate that Bluetooth 5 is a valid technology candidate for implementation of Internet of Things applications, provided that activity level, expected coverage areas and the interference situation within the ISM band are carefully considered in the deployment process.},   keywords={Bluetooth;frequency hop communication;Internet of Things;Bluetooth 5;Internet of Things;scalability analysis;hyped 5G networks;realistic application activity levels;Internet of Things applications;Bluetooth;Analytical models;Sensitivity;Internet of Things;Mathematical model;Scalability;Throughput},   doi={10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292720},   ISSN={2166-9589},   month={Oct},}

Based on the traditional dictionary learning methods, which neglects the relationship between the sample and the dictionary atom, we propose the weighted mechanism to connect the sample with the dictionary atom in this paper. Meanwhile, the traditional dictionary learning method is prone to cause over-fitting for patient classification of the limited training data set. Therefore, this paper adopts l<sub>2</sub>-norm regularization constraint, which realizes the limitation of the model space, and enhances the generalization ability of the model and avoids over-fitting to some extent. Compared with the previous shallow dictionary learning, this paper proposed the greedy deep dictionary learning. We adopt the thinking of layer by layer training to increase the hidden layer, so that the local information between the layer and the layer can be trained to maintain their own characteristics, reduce the risk of overfitting and make sure that each layer of the network is convergent, which improves the accuracy of training and learning. With the development of Internet of Things and the soundness of healthcare monitoring system, the method proposed have better reliability in the field of mobile multimedia for healthcare. The results show that the learning method has a good effect on the classification of mobile multimedia for medical diseases, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classification have good performance, which may provide guidance for the diagnosis of disease in wisdom medical.},   keywords={diseases;greedy algorithms;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;mobile computing;multimedia systems;pattern classification;greedy deep learning method;medical disease analysis;greedy deep weighted dictionary;mobile multimedia;medical diseases analysis;traditional dictionary learning method;dictionary atom;greedy deep dictionary learning;shallow dictionary learning;patient classification;l2-norm regularization constraint;Internet of Things;healthcare;disease diagnosis;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Big Data;Medical services;Dictionaries;Training;Medical big data;machine learning;mobile multimedia;deep learning;dictionary learning;patient classification},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2823979},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL.

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={23-30},   abstract={Many extreme-scale scientific applications are distributed in nature and oftentimes need to move vast amounts of data between multiple locations for various remote operations. Such applications require fast and reliable data transfer services with guaranteed finish time, which can be realized by making bandwidth reservation for dedicated channel provisioning in high-performance networks. From an individual perspective, a user always wishes to achieve the earliest finish time for a given data transfer request that typically specifies the maximum Local Area Network (LAN) bandwidth constraint, the data size, data available time, and the deadline. From a global perspective, the network service provider would attempt to serve as many users' bandwidth reservation requests (BRRs) as possible to maximize the overall network resource utilization and throughput. As for the high-performance network consuming vast amounts energy and network resources, the network service provider would also want to process BRRs efficiently to save energy, network resource and the network maintenance cost. These goals are potentially conflictive and require a careful design of the bandwidth reservation and scheduling algorithm. In this paper, we focus on one particular type of scheduling problem under the constraint of fixed path and varying bandwidth (FPVB), which has been proven to be NP-complete in the literature. We develop two heuristic algorithms, namely Least Available Bandwidth of Edge (LABE) and Largest Available Bandwidth of Path (LABP), to solve this problem and conduct simulation-based performance evaluation. The extensive simulation results illustrate the superiority of these proposed algorithms in terms of execution time, success ratio, and average data transfer completion time of BRRs in comparison with two existing scheduling algorithms.},   keywords={bandwidth allocation;communication complexity;energy conservation;energy consumption;local area networks;resource allocation;scheduling;extreme-scale scientific applications;remote operations;data transfer services;channel provisioning;high-performance networks;data transfer request;maximum local area network;LAN bandwidth constraint;data size;data available time;data deadline;network service provider;bandwidth reservation requests;BRR;network resource utilization;network resource throughput;energy consumption;energy saving;network maintenance cost;scheduling algorithm;scheduling problem;fixed path and varying bandwidth scheduling;FPVB;NP-complete;heuristic algorithms;least available bandwidth of edge;LABE;largest available bandwidth of path;LABP;simulation-based performance;evaluation;execution time;success ratio;average data transfer completion time;Bandwidth;Data transfer;Algorithm design and analysis;Scheduling;Arrays;Processor scheduling;Network topology},   doi={10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.30},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

 title={Patients' Adoption of WSN-Based Smart Home Healthcare Systems: An Integrated Model of Facilitators and Barriers}, 
  year={2017},   volume={60},   number={1},   pages={4-23},   abstract={Background: Patient-centered care emphasizes care coordination and communication through active involvement of patients, their families, physicians, and other professionals to improve decision making. Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. Research problem: Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. Research questions: What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? Literature review: We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. Methodology: We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. Results and conclusions: We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.},   keywords={health care;home computing;Internet of Things;patient care;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;patients adoption;WSN-based smart home healthcare system;patient-centered care;smart telecommunication technology;Internet of Things;wireless sensor network;generic technology adoption model;WSN-SHHS research;WSN-SHHS application;technology adoption theory;pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model;home healthcare agency;home healthcare patient;Kvale approach;human detachment;life-quality expectancy;predictive power accounting;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Context modeling;Predictive models;Smart homes;Collaboration;Technological innovation;Internet of things;smart home healthcare systems;usability;wireless-sensor network},   doi={10.1109/TPC.2016.2632822},   ISSN={0361-1434},   month={March},}

This project is an Arduino-controlled, consumer device which dispenses the correct amount of medication of the correct type. A textured cone was found to be the ideal method of trapping precisely one pill at a time to prevent overdose. After the medication is dispensed, the user is notified via SMS that his/her medication is ready to be taken. This device is also configurable via an Android application; a caretaker can select dates and times the medication will be dispensed for up to three types of medication. The device relies on an HC-06 Bluetooth module for a serial activation signal. The first set of results obtained measured how often the correct pill was dispensed and how often a single pill was trapped and dispensed. The success rate was over 93% for each pill type, ranging in diameter from 0.48 cm to 2.29 cm. The second set of results measured time elapsed between the scheduled release of a pill and the actual release of the pill followed by the user receiving an SMS notification. The time elapsed was under 10 seconds for every pill type. Apart from the preliminary step of loading the medication in the device, this model is fully automated and is the most effective in the current market.},   keywords={Android (operating system);biomedical electronics;Bluetooth;computerised instrumentation;consumer electronics;drugs;microcontrollers;autonomous pill dispenser;tablet medication delivery mechanization;Arduino-controlled consumer device;textured cone;Android application;HC-06 Bluetooth module;serial activation signal;pill type;pill diameter;SMS notification;Androids;Humanoid robots;Bluetooth;DC motors;Servomotors;Consumer electronics;Testing;Consumer electronics;Applied engineering;Mechatronics;Robotic and Autonomous systems;Healthcare electronics;Medical electronics;Arduino;Mobile computing;Wireless computing;Bluetooth integration;Patient care;Microcontroller;Medication control;Medication scheduling;Internet of Things;Android;Application},   doi={10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777886},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

In this work we postulate that vehicles have a previously unexplored role to play in driving widespread acceptance, and adoption, of mobile cloud, IoT and AAL principles, concepts and systems. We argue that, historically, deployment of new, disruptive technological paradigms has been slow and the notion of IoT devices being deeply embedded in our everyday environment, and working and collaborating to enhance and support our daily existences (Ambient Assisted Living), makes "realizing tomorrow's potential difficult. But not impossible" for industry actors.

The new features offered by fog computing (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), if successfully applied for time-sensitive healthcare applications, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early notification of emergency situations to support smart decision making. While promising, how to design and develop real-world fog computing-based data monitoring system is still an open question. As a first step to answer this question, in this research, we employ a fog-based cloud paradigm for time-sensitive medical applications and also propose to show the practical applicability and significance of such a novel system. The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor devices is creating a new environment, namely the Internet of Things (IoT) that enables a wide range of future Internet applications.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Various global development opportunities have been escalated through the Internet of Everything (IoE) with the potential of progressing Sustainable Development goals - dramatically accelerating and improving lives of millions. The emerging economies of developing countries with minimal investments have crafted a huge array of (IoE) technologies strongly demanding interoperability and interconnectivity that are affordable, scalable and available, significantly improving people's quality of life. Growing number of devices requiring interconnectivity referring to the concept of (IoE) headed beyond sensors, chips, computers and smartphones. The modern replete technology has enabled both synchronous and asynchronous communication without human interaction in many industrial processes, fleet management, stock exchanges, inventory systems and environment monitoring regardless of their extensive deployment. Information Communication Technology (ICT) is a fast evolving industry in developing countries, offering (IoE)'s huge potential of transformation and disruption. The global development challenges have emphasised the need for communication and due to (IoE) advancements, long-standing issues (health care, stock, management, cross-border, technology diffusion etc.) would be surmounted in an affordable and quick manner. The developing countries would turn-around with the help of a long-awaited (IoE) technology aiming at improving their economies and lives of millions of people. The key to increased usage is the interconnectedness of diverse range of devices which formerly were incompatible with each other. The interoperability between devices has rendered (IoE) both practical and possible and in accordance with the international communication standards. Research and industrial organisations have stipulated the formation of a hyper-connected society where tens of billions daily life objects and devices would communicate, forming a global network of smart devices. The successful provision of intelligent and smart devices through (IoE) services leads to challenging security concerns especially in developing countries where communication and devices are cheap but there is a lack of secure (IoE) infrastructures. The current paper would envisage a secure architecture for diversely connected objects within developing countries. A secure configuration methodology of the bootstrapping scheme is proposed as a solution in this paper. The bootstrapping scheme is activated as soon as a new object get connected to an operational network. This method is feasible to secure the devices and avoid data exploitation within developing countries where communication across devices is still lacking protected infrastructures.

This paper investigates channel capacity and outage performance of ambient backscatter communication systems. Specifically, a calculation method is proposed to facilitate capacity analysis, and the ambient backscatter system capacities are derived in the case of four different RF signals. It is surprisingly found that the channel capacity is obtained when the RF signals are not equiprobably backscattered by tag, and that the capacity with complex Gaussian RF signals is not exactly twice that with real ones for the ambient backscatter communication systems. Then, the outage probability and its asymptotic value in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime are obtained. Since the exact outage expression consists of an infinite number of terms, a tight truncation error bound is derived to reasonably estimate the number of effective terms for numerical simulation.

Queuing system, Delay in treatment, Difficult to treat rural people, Disability to do remote treatment are the major issues in current health care system. Internet of Things (IoT) allows caring of people from remote locations with the help of integration of wireless sensor network with internet. Different sensors are used to measure different health parameters. Processing of smart health care data in an efficient manner is necessary. Slight time variation causes severe effect such as loss of life. In IoT, delay occur in processing large volume of sensor data in real time. Energy spent by the sensors also affected by processing delay. Because sensors spent energy in idle state. To reduce delay in processing smart health care data, Multi core technology is included with IoT. SixLoWPAN is the technique used to connect low configured devices with internet. In this paper, Task Level Parallelism (TLP) is applied to process different health parameters in parallel. TLP utilizes the available resources in optimal way. It makes our system as more efficient. The proposed system improves performance upto 65.5%. Efficient system also reduces power consumption of the devices.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={683-689},   abstract={In a community with everyday growing population, the production of waste also increases which leads to the possibility of overflowing disposal sites. This proposes a worrisome problem to waste management companies as well as people in the community due to the rise in pollution caused by overflowing trash. Apart from pollution, diseases can also easily spread if overflowing waste are left uncollected. The goal of this paper would be to overcome all these difficulties in handling waste through designing a smart waste bin system that is not only cost-effective but also environmental friendly. This particular system would also be able to communicate with waste management companies to take care of the overflowing disposal sites. The system involves the combination of a primary trash bin and an attached expanding auxiliary trash bin. The primary bin will have an ultrasonic sensor attached to its lid which allows it to detect the level of waste within the bin and once it reaches maximum capacity, signal for pick-up will be transmitted to the waste management company. Furthermore, to solve the immediate full capacity issue of the bin, the primary bin encompasses a compactor used to compress trash within the bin before overflowing. Additionally, the auxiliary bin would expand to contain additional waste while waiting for pick-up. The whole system is powered by solar panels attached to the lid of the primary bin, thus making it an environmentally friendly system.},   keywords={Waste management;Urban areas;Companies;Solar panels;Physics;GSM;Light emitting diodes;Smart cities;Internet of Things (IOT);Smart waste bin;surveillance system;eco-friendly system;self-powered system;smart trash can},   doi={10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450470},   ISSN={2376-6506},   month={June},}

As one of the most important and promising IoT areas, a vehicular information network aims to implement a myriad of applications related to vehicles, traffic information, drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. However, intervehicular communication (IVC) in a vehicular information network is still based on the TCP/IP protocol stack which is not efficient and scalable. To address the efficiency and scalability issues of the IVC, we leverage the named data networking (NDN) paradigm where the end user only cares about the needed content and pays no attention to the actual location of the content. The NDN model is highly suitable for the IVC scenario with its hierarchical content naming scheme and flexible content retrieval and caching support. We design a novel vehicular information network architecture based on the basic communication principle of NDN. Our proposed architecture aims to improve content naming, addressing, data aggregation, and mobility for IVC in the vehicular information network. In addition, the key parameter settings of the proposed schemes are analyzed in order to help guide their actual deployment.},   keywords={intelligent transportation systems;Internet of Things;mobile communication;mobility management (mobile radio);transport protocols;vehicular information network architecture;named data networking;NDN;Internet of Things technologies;IoT technologies;intervehicular communication;IVC;TCP/IP protocol stack;content naming scheme;flexible content retrieval;data aggregation;Vehiclular ad hoc networks;Internet;Routing;Computer architecture;Sensors;Road traffic;Intelligent structures;Caching;Internet;Internet of Things (IoT);mobility management;named data networking (NDN);performance},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2354294},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

The problem lies in the elimination of corruption through the formation and implementation of the state program Creation of Cyber Physical Space for Digital Monitoring Technological Processes and Optimal Resource Management in order to Achieve Socially Important Goals. The cyber technology for human-free managing social resources (staff and finance) includes two cloud service: 1) the distribution of government contracts and finance between the structures, undertakings and entities, based on competition of their competence matrices for a given metric; 2) allocation of staff vacancies in scalable social groups based on competition of the competence matrices of applicants for a given metric. The competence metric is a measuring method of the distance between objects or processes based on the use of the parameter vector that defines the space or a competence matrix of a person or social group in real time. A competence matrix is a model of integrated activity and skills of a person or social group at a given metric and time interval. As an alternative solution of the problem it is considered a cyber physical system for managing human and financial resources (Cyber Social Systems - CSS), as a scalable cloud service, available to the social groups, government agencies, private companies and private individuals; it provides lifelong monitoring competencies of corresponding subjects in real time in order to carry out cyber staff management through appropriate career, moral and material incentives according to the results of their constructive activity. The cyber social system is focused on the total destruction of the corruption in the actions of managers at all levels by eliminating the subjectivity in the management of human and financial resources on the basis of the transfer of the official functions to independent cloud cyber service. The system consists of two interacting components: 1) accumulative monitoring of all kinds of human (social group) activity that generates a competence matrix in real-time; 2) the optimal management through career, moral and material incentives of individuals and social formations based on the analysis and rating of the corresponding competence matrices.

Current approaches usually make applications operate in separate silos, as the functionality of IoT devices is fixed by vendors and typically accessed only through low-level proprietary APIs. This limits the flexibility in designing applications and requires intense wireless interactions, which may impact energy consumption. COIN is a system architecture that breaks this separation by allowing developers to flexibly run a slice of a mobile app's logic onto IoT devices. Mobile apps can dynamically deploy arbitrary tasks implemented as loosely coupled components. The underlying runtime support takes care of the coordination across tasks and of their real-time scheduling.

 title={Towards truthful auction for big data trading}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={In this paper, we address the issue of data trading in big data markets. Data trading problems have attracted increased attention recently, as the economic benefits and potential of big data trading are substantial and varied. However, how to effectively trade data between the data owners (sellers) and data collectors/users (buyers) is far from settled, and requires careful design. Auction mechanisms have been applied across many fields, and have significant potential to facilitate data transactions in a fair, truthful, and secure way. Nonetheless, a truthful auction must ensure the property of incentive compatibility, meaning that the bidders can obtain highest utility if and only if they submit their bids and asks truthfully. Furthermore, a truthful and fair auction should also protect the optimal auction results from being manipulated by false-name bidding attacks, where users (participants) utilize multiple identities or accounts to influence the auction results. To tackle these issues, we propose a Multi-round False-name Proof Auction (MFPA) scheme, which enables data trading among data owners (sellers) and data collectors (buyers). We prove that our MFPA scheme achieves the properties of incentive compatibility, false-name bidding proofness, and computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that MFPA achieves good performance in terms of social surplus, satisfaction ratio, and computation overhead.},   keywords={Big Data;big data trading;big data markets;data owners;data transactions;truthful auction;fair auction;Multi-round False-name Proof Auction scheme;Big Data;Electronic mail;Economics;Organizations;Twitter;Cost accounting;Consumer electronics;Cyber-Physical Systems;Internet of Things;Big Data;Trading},   doi={10.1109/PCCC.2017.8280501},   ISSN={2374-9628},   month={Dec},}

The hospital wireless network is one important 6LoWPAN application of the IoT, where it keeps continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs while the patients are on the move. Proper mobility management is needed to maintain connectivity between patient nodes and the hospital network to monitor their exact locations. It should also support fault tolerance and optimize energy consumption of the devices. In this paper, we survey IPv6 mobility protocols and propose some solutions which make it more suitable to a hospital architecture based on 6LoWPAN technology. Our initial numerical results show a reduction of the handoff costs on the mobile router which normally constitute a bottleneck in such a system.

New approaches are currently used : the fog computing paradigm, which describe the IoT environment in a more relevant way than the cloud vision, provides new performances as low latency, local storage opportunities, end-to-user services. E-health fogs have attracted a lot of attentions. To realize the efficient communication, E-Health systems also introduce Content-Centric Network (CCN) approach, whose characteristics include quick response, content distribution, IoT oriented technology. Nowadays, the existing E-health fog or CCN are seen as separate and autonomous networks, but many applications could require that those E-health fog computing systems exchange data, share processing results, or subscribe to each other information flux.

The IoT technology is also envisioned to play an important role in improving the effectiveness of military operations in battlefields. The interconnection of combat equipment and other battlefield resources for coordinated automated decisions is referred to as the Internet of battlefield things (IoBT). IoBT networks are significantly different from traditional IoT networks due to battlefield specific challenges, such as the absence of communication infrastructure, heterogeneity of devices, and susceptibility to cyber-physical attacks. The combat efficiency and coordinated decision-making in war scenarios depends highly on real-time data collection, which in turn relies on the connectivity of the network and information dissemination in the presence of adversaries. This paper aims to build the theoretical foundations of designing secure and reconfigurable IoBT networks. Leveraging the theories of stochastic geometry and mathematical epidemiology, we develop an integrated framework to quantify the information dissemination among heterogeneous network devices. Consequently, a tractable optimization problem is formulated that can assist commanders in cost effectively planning the network and reconfiguring it according to the changing mission requirements.},   keywords={decision making;information dissemination;Internet of Things;military communication;military computing;optimisation;security of data;secure IoBT networks;reconfigurable IoBT networks;heterogeneous network devices;critical information dissemination;management;control;automated systems;paradigm shift;smart homes;smart cities;health care;IoT technology;military operations;battlefields;combat equipment;battlefield resources;coordinated automated decisions;battlefield specific challenges;cyber-physical attacks;combat efficiency;coordinated decision-making;IoT networks;Internet of battlefield things;reconfigurable multilayer network design;changing mission requirements;Geometry;Communication networks;Mathematical model;Multiplexing;Wireless communication;Stochastic processes;Ad hoc networks;Battlefield;epidemics;Internet of Things;multiplex networks;Poisson point process;random geometric graph},   doi={10.1109/TWC.2018.2799860},   ISSN={1536-1276},   month={April},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Wearable health devices, mobile apps and diagnostic tools revolutionize the medical field by introducing new assisting devices for patients in a way to create comfort, communication and augmented intelligence. Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.},   keywords={artificial intelligence;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient monitoring;social networking (online);diagnostic tools;augmented intelligence;sensor devices;gateway;evidence-based medicine system;SMEAD;end-to-end secured system;diabetic patients;medication;insulin dosage;cryptographic security;formalized data access;secured mobile enabled assisting device;wearable health devices;mobile apps;cloud-based platforms;Internet of Things;MEDIBOX;blockchain-based disruptive technology;smart contracts;social networks;diabetics monitoring;patient assisting devices;privacy;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Diabetes;Medical diagnostic imaging;Security;Temperature sensors;Diabetics Monitoring;MEDIBOX;Blockchain;IOT;Mobile Phone},   doi={10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384099},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

The current hospital centric healthcare system is becoming inefficient to treat conditions that demand immediate treatment such as heart strokes. So, the focus is now tilting from hospital centric treatment to patient centric treatment. This project proposes a health monitoring system which monitors vital parameters of the patient such as temperature and heart rate using sensors as well as a fitbit which are connected to a raspberry pi board. The project involves alerting the doctor through SMS if any vital parameter of the patient deviates from the normal value. Apart from helping the doctor monitor the patient's basic health parameters this health monitoring system also ensures that the patient takes the prescribed medication at the right times. The raspberry pi acts as a personal server which logs the details of the patient's medication. The patient is sent reminders to take medicines through SMS according to his prescription.},   keywords={diseases;health care;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;patient treatment;heart diseases;heart strokes;hospital centric treatment;patient centric treatment;health monitoring system;heart rate;raspberry pi board;hospital centric healthcare system;chronic diseases;Medical services;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Databases;Heart beat;Raspberry Pi;Internet of Things;health monitoring system},   doi={10.1109/BID.2017.8336583},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Providing a space maintained QoL, i.e., maintaining the indoor comfort in a house is one of the main components of smart space. This study provides indoor comfort with a networked lighting system. The proposed system has two main functions: (1) controlling full color OLED lights via Wi-Fi, and (2) collecting data related to the environment as well as people's entries and exits for evaluation of the system to determine whether the system helps in providing comfort and is used by people who do not use the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Function (1) provides for automatic operation and control of full color changing OLED lights via Wi-Fi. Function (2) measures, collects, and stores the data almost at real-time and utilizes them for the evaluation of the system itself in order to maintain indoor comfort by the networked lights. To test the effectiveness of the system, it was installed at a day-care center in northern Japan for six months. According to the results, the proposed system showed 100% operation checking rate 210 times, and the evaluation functions showed the rate of indoor comfort, indicated as Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values.

  year={2017},   volume={64},   number={11},   pages={2920-2933},   abstract={Supply-voltage reduction in digital circuits beyond the minimum energy per operation point is advantageous for supply-voltage-constrained applications and can help to considerably reduce standby power consumption. Schmitt trigger (ST) logic allows for ultra-low voltage (ULV) operation; hardware implementations with supply voltages as low as 62mV have been demonstrated. In this paper, a systematic in-depth analysis of ST logic is presented. First, it is shown that ST logic allows for operation at supply voltages below the ultimate limit of standard digital CMOS circuits, making it-to the best of our knowledge- the only approach proposed to date for operation of digital circuits in this voltage region. The factors critical to the ultimate limit of supply voltage reduction are the ON-to-OFF current ratio of the transistors and the susceptibility to global variability. It is shown that ST logic provides improvements over standard CMOS logic in both of these aspects. The hysteresis that occurs in ST circuits at nominal supply voltage could potentially limit the applicability for ULV operation and is therefore carefully investigated. Furthermore, a systematic approach to optimum sizing of ST gates is presented for the first time. ST gates exhibit inherent overheads with respect to gate area, delay, and leakage, which are carefully evaluated. Compared with standard CMOS gates designed for the same minimum supply voltage, it is shown that ST gates, nevertheless, are the most efficient solution if the target minimum supply voltage is sufficiently low: with respect to area, this limit is at VDD 110 mV and with respect to power/delay at VDD ≈ 75 mV.},   keywords={CMOS logic circuits;Internet of Things;logic design;logic gates;low-power electronics;power consumption;trigger circuits;ST logic;ST circuits;ULV operation;ST gates;IoT applications;schmitt trigger gates;schmitt trigger logic;ultra-low voltage;supply voltage reduction;CMOS gates;digital CMOS circuits;CMOS logic;ultra-subthreshold operation;always-on digital circuits;supply-voltage-constrained applications;standby power consumption;ultra-low voltage operation;ON-to-OFF current ratio;transistors;voltage 62.0 mV;voltage 110.0 mV;voltage 75.0 mV;Logic gates;Transistors;Standards;Power demand;Threshold voltage;Digital circuits;Inverters;CMOS digital integrated circuits;design methodology;dynamic voltage scaling;low power;process variations;reliability;Schmitt trigger;sub-threshold;ultra-low voltage logic},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2017.2705053},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={Nov},}

 title={Privacy Preservation in e-Healthcare Environments: State of the Art and Future Directions}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={464-478},   abstract={e-Healthcare promises to be the next big wave in healthcare. It offers all the advantages and benefits imaginable by both the patient and the user. However, current e-Healthcare systems are not yet fully developed and mature, and thus lack the degree of confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and user trust necessary to be widely implemented. Two primary aspects of any operational healthcare enterprise are the quality of healthcare services and patient trust over the healthcare enterprise. Trust is intertwined with issues like confidentiality, integrity, accountability, authenticity, identity, and data management, to name a few. Privacy remains one of the biggest obstacles to ensuring the success of e-Healthcare solutions in winning patient trust as it indirectly covers most security concerns. Addressing privacy concerns requires addressing security issues like access control, authentication, non-repudiation, and accountability, without which end-to-end privacy cannot be ensured. Achieving privacy from the point of data collection in wireless sensor networks, to incorporating the Internet of Things, to communication links, and to data storage and access, is a huge undertaking and requires extensive work. Privacy requirements are further compounded by the fact that the data handled in an enterprise are of an extremely personal and private nature, and its mismanagement, either intentionally or unintentionally, could seriously hurt both the patient and future prospects of an e-Healthcare enterprise. Research carried out in order to address privacy concerns is not homogenous in nature. It focuses on the failure of certain parts of the e-Healthcare enterprise to fully address all aspects of privacy. In the middle of this ongoing research and implementation, a gradual shift has occurred, moving e-Healthcare enterprise controls away from an organizational level toward the level of patients. This is intended to give patients more control and authority over decision making regarding their protected health information/electronic health record. A lot of works and efforts are necessary in order to better assess the feasibility of this major shift in e-Healthcare enterprises. Existing research can be naturally divided on the basis of techniques used. These include data anonymization/pseudonymization and access control mechanisms primarily for stored data privacy. This, however, results in giving a back seat to certain privacy requirements (accountability, integrity, non-repudiation, and identity management). This paper reviews research carried out in this regard and explores whether this research offers any possible solutions to either patient privacy requirements for e-Healthcare or possibilities for addressing the (technical as well as psychological) privacy concerns of the users.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;medical information systems;data privacy;patient privacy;e-Healthcare systems;e-Healthcare enterprise;end-to-end privacy;healthcare services;Privacy;Medical services;Electronic mail;Wireless sensor networks;Access control;Data privacy;e-Healthcare;privacy;anonymity;access control},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2767561},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Study of Dynamic Topology Change for Total Energy Consumption in Green IP Networks}, 
  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={64-70},   abstract={In this work, we investigate the routing and dynamic link on/off management for green IP networks. Two approaches are evaluated: Global Topology Change (GTC) and Local Traffic Redirect (LTR). In GTC, the on/off state of each link is known by all of the routers in the network. Any link state change will trigger a network topology update in each router. In the transient period link state change, the inconsistency of topology images among different routers would result in traffic loops. In LTR, the link on/off states are only known by the owner of those links. The image of global network topology is remained fixed for each router no matter how the link state changes. The benefit of this approach is that the network topology is kept the same in each router. However, each router has to carefully maintain its own routing table to manage the flows going through it. The contribution of this paper includes four parts. First, we evaluate GTC and LTR to determine which is better for achieving green IP networks. Second, we address the dynamic control mechanism of link on/off states so as to alter network topology for power saving. A threshold-based scheme is proposed to determine the timing of changing link states. The third contribution comes from that we propose a protocol for updating link on/off states for the GTC approach. This protocol gives networks immunity from the traffic loop problems. It also prevents the network from being disconnected when multiple routers turn off their links at the same time. Since network survivability is mandatory to guarantee network integrity, in the fourth contribution of this paper, we propose an IP protection scheme to guarantee 100% network survivability against any single node failure while maintaining energy efficiency.},   keywords={IP networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;dynamic topology change;total energy consumption;green IP networks;dynamic link on-off management;global topology change;local traffic redirect;routers;link state change;network topology;transient period link state change;topology images;traffic loops;routing table;power saving;threshold-based scheme;traffic loop problems;network integrity;IP protection scheme;network survivability;single node failure;energy efficiency;IP networks;Heuristic algorithms;Green products;Network topology;Routing protocols;Routing;Energy Efficient IP Network;Routing and Active Topology Management;Loop Free Routing;Power-aware Link State Management Algorithm;Survivable Green IP Network},   doi={10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.36},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

 title={Evaluating the use of TLS and DTLS protocols in IoT middleware systems applied to E-health}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={480-485},   abstract={The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought new security requirements in terms of communication services with respect to data transmitted in mobile networks. Although IoT middleware systems have been used to cope with the most relevant requirements demanded by different IoT applications, security is a special topic that is not mature enough in this kind of technology. E-health is an example of environment that exposes sensitive data. The security challenges regarding e-health applications are concentrated mainly on issues surrounding the communication layer, specially those cases where data are transmitted over insecure networks. TLS and DTLS protocols have been chosen by most of the existing IoT systems in order to protect such communications. However, none of them was designed to be used in IoT situations. In addition, none of the existing works analyzes their suitability to the IoT regarding the usage of mobile networks, which are common in real-world scenarios of e-health. In this paper, we analyze the use of TLS and DTLS protocols in IoT middleware systems applied to the e-health environment regarding performance (i.e., response time), overhead, network latency and packet loss when operating in mobile networks. We evaluated both protocols through a specific e-health scenario. Tests revealed the usage of mobile networks increases response time and overhead of both protocols, on average, when compared to traditional networks.},   keywords={computer network security;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;middleware;protocols;radiocommunication;TLS protocols;DTLS protocols;IoT middleware systems;Internet of Things;communication services;mobile networks;IoT applications;e-health applications;communication layer;IoT systems;e-health environment;network latency;packet loss;Middleware;Protocols;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Authentication;Time factors},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983155},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

Further, many of them will have stringent size constraints. With no cord for power and limited space for a battery, powering these devices (to achieve several months to possibly years of unattended operation) becomes a daunting challenge. This paper highlights some promising directions for addressing this challenge, focusing on three main building blocks: (a) the design of ultra-low power hardware platforms that integrate computing, sensing, storage, and wireless connectivity in a tiny form factor, (b) the development of intelligent system-level power management techniques, and (c) the use of environmental energy harvesting to make IoT devices self-powered, thus decreasing - in some cases, even eliminating - their dependence on batteries. We discuss these building blocks in detail and illustrate case-studies of systems that use them judiciously, including the QUBE wireless embedded platform, which exploits the characteristics of emerging non-volatile memory technologies to seamlessly and efficiently enable long-running computations in systems that experience frequent power loss (i.e., intermittently powered systems).},   keywords={embedded systems;energy harvesting;Internet of Things;power aware computing;Internet of Things;societal-scale problems;ultralow power hardware platforms;wireless connectivity;intelligent system-level power management techniques;environmental energy harvesting;IoT devices;batteries;QUBE wireless embedded platform;nonvolatile memory technologies;Batteries;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Random access memory;Sensors;Power demand;Nonvolatile memory;Internet of Things;Low Power;Power Management;Energy Harvesting;Perpetual Systems;Wearable Computing},   doi={10.1145/2627369.2631644},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

At the core of this transformation lies "data". This transformation is facilitated by embedded devices, collectively known as Internet of Things (IoT), which produce real-time feeds of sensor data which are collected and processed to produce a dynamic physical model used for optimized real-time decision making. At the infrastructure level, there is a need to develop a scalable architecture for processing massive volumes of present and historical data at an unprecedented velocity to support the IoT paradigm. To cope with such extreme scale, we argue for the need to revisit the hardware and software co-design landscape in light of two key technological advancements. First is the virtualization of computation and storage over highly distributed data centers spanning across continents. Second is the emergence of a variety of specialized hardware accelerators that complement traditional general-purpose processors. Further efforts are required to unify these two trends in order to harness the power of big data. In this paper, we present a formulation and characterization of the hardware acceleration landscape geared towards real-time analytics in the cloud. Our goal is to assist both researchers and practitioners navigating the newly revived field of software and hardware co-design for building next generation distributed systems.

Although face-to-face behavioral programs have proven to be most effective, they are expensive and often inaccessible. The use of virtual worlds has been emerging as an alternative to perform experiments, as it offers to the user a sense of reality, allowing interaction with 3D objects. This paper discusses the use of the Internet of Things in virtual worlds, with a view to encourage obese individuals to learn more about self-care in order to improve their life quality and lose weight. One of the key factors to deal with obesity is the engagement of the subject. The qualitative research investigated the impact of the alliance of 3D virtual worlds with the Internet of Things and mobile devices as elements capable of promoting motivation in subjects enrolled in an obesity control program. This set of technologies was used as a support strategy aimed at offering to the user the feeling of "being present" in a context particularly developed to encourage motivation and learning with the interaction with 3D objects. This paper has a cutout on the pedagogical use of the theoretical background, which is the Theory of Self-determination and it explains how the software that validated the proposal was developed.

Under this regime, the present work details an event-triggering technique (ETT) for efficient and effective tracking of road vehicles in the realm of intelligent transportation systems. The technique assumes that both the local and remote host follow a predetermined mobility model to approximate the actual vehicle location. Upon detection of deviation from this model, the local host triggers an update event to resynchronize the remote host. Within the proposed ETT, both the mobility model, as well as the detection thresholds are calculated solely based on sensory data, making the whole system both scalable and robust to dynamic changes. Experimental results demonstrate the many-fold improvements in efficiency of the proposed solution compared to traditional periodic tracking. These improvements are also validated in practice through an implementation on an operating bus route service.},   keywords={intelligent transportation systems;Internet of Things;object tracking;road vehicles;trip changes tracking;Internet of Things;IoT;automotive sectors;healthcare sectors;security;real-time interaction;innovative applications;event-triggering technique;ETT;road vehicles tracking;intelligent transportation systems;mobility model;vehicle location;detection thresholds;periodic tracking;bus route service;Vehicles;Global Positioning System;Time-frequency analysis;Monitoring;Roads;Time measurement;Computational modeling;Road Transport;Data-Driven Event-Triggering;Internet of Things;Bus Tracking},   doi={10.1109/ITSC.2015.93},   ISSN={2153-0017},   month={Sept},}

Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;adaptive LPA validation model;LPAV-IoT;data reliability;IoT healthcare environments;mobile apps;LPA data;IoT environment;data validation model;lifelogging data;personal data;healthcare studies;healthcare system;personalized healthcare platform;lifelogging physical activity;Internet of things;Medical services;Uncertainty;Biomedical monitoring;Adaptation models;Reliability;Data models;Data validation;Internet of Things (IoT);personalized healthcare;physical activity},   doi={10.1109/TSMC.2016.2586075},   ISSN={2168-2216},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={1-12},   abstract={This paper presents a new platform to monitor the arm and hand activity of stroke patients during rehabilitation exercises in the hospital and at home during their daily living activities. The platform provides relevant data to the therapist in order to assess the patients physical state and adapt the rehabilitation program if necessary. The platform consists of a self-contained smart cup that can be used to perform exercises that are similar to everyday tasks such as drinking. The first smart cup prototype, the design of which was based on interviews regarding the needs of therapists, contains various sensors that collect information about its orientation, the liquid level, its position compared to a reference target and tremors. The prototype also includes audio and visual displays that provide feedback to patients about their movements. Two studies were carried out in conjunction with healthcare professionals and patients. The first study focused on collecting feedback from healthcare professionals to assess the functionalities of the cup and to improve the prototype. Based on this paper, we designed an improved prototype and created a visualization tool for therapists. Finally, we carried out a preliminary study involving nine patients who had experienced an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in the previous 24 months. This preliminary study focused on assessing the usability and acceptability of the cup to the patients. The results showed that the cup was very well accepted by eight of the nine patients in monitoring their activity within a rehabilitation center or at home.

There are several mature frameworks that address these issues, but they have been developed within the context of organised hospitals and care providers, where there is the expertise, processing power, communications and electrical power to support highly robust security. However, for IoT solutions aimed at vulnerable people, either at home or within their local environment, there are significant additional constraints that must be overcome.

In HIoTN, there is a need, where a user can directly access the real-time data from the sensing nodes for a particular application in generic IoT networking environment. This paper emphasizes on the design of a new secure lightweight three-factor remote user authentication scheme for HIoTNs, called the user authenticated key management protocol (UAKMP). The three factors used in UAKMP are the user smart card, password, and personal biometrics. The security of the scheme is thoroughly analyzed under the formal security in the widely accepted real-or-random model, the informal security as well as the formal security verification using the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. UAKMP offers several functionality features including offline sensing node registration, freely password and biometric update facility, user anonymity, and sensing node anonymity compared to other related existing schemes.

In such an environment, smart healthcare also needs to be expedited with an aim to provide remote diagnosis to patients located across the globe. However, as the sensitive information about a patient travels using an open channel (i.e., the Internet), there are chances of misusing this information. Hence, there is a requirement for a strong crypto mechanism for securely processing smart healthcare data. Most of the solutions reported in the literature use heavy computation-based solutions for providing security to smart healthcare data, which may not be suitable in view of less resources for modern smart devices. In this article, we propose a novel lattice-based secure cryptosystem for smart healthcare (LSCSH) in future smart cities.

Over the last four decades, the relentless pursuit of IC device miniaturization for manufacturing high-performance and high-density IC-chips and system-on-a-chip (SoC) led to the creation of Internet and social media. The semiconductor components are used in smart cars, smart homes, smart cities, smart health, smart energy, smart security, smart appliances, and so on. The Internet enables connecting any and every smart devices or “things” creating “Internet of Things” (IoT) or Internet of everything (IoE). And, the IoT-connected smart devices constitute a smart environment and integrated ecosystem that can be accessed via personal computers, tablets, and smartphones from anywhere without human interaction. However, the performance of nanoscale-MOSFETs in the design and manufacturing of “smart” electronic products necessary to create smart networks or “smart things” to enable smart environments and integrated ecosystems is inadequate due to the fundamental physical limitations such as short channel effects (SCEs). Shrinking conventional bulk MOSFET device dimensions in the decananometer regime degrades device performance including degradation in the subthreshold swing and decrease in device turn-on voltage. As a result, the scaled MOSFETs cannot be turned off easily by lowering the gate voltage leading to excessive leakage current. Due to SCEs, the device characteristics become increasingly sensitive to process variation that imposes a serious challenge for continued scaling of bulk-MOSFETs for the nanometer technology nodes. In addition, at gate length below 20-nm, the sub-surface leakage paths are weakly controlled by the gate irrespective of gate oxide thickness and their potential barriers can be easily lowered by drain bias through the enhanced electric field coupling to the drain. Thus, to surmount the continuous scaling challenges of conventional bulk MOSFET devices new device technologies such as FinFET has emerged as the real alternative to MOSFETs. This tutorial provides the basic features and operating principles of FinFETs required for the understanding of design and manufacturing of advanced ICs at the nanometer nodes for smart electronic products. In addition, this tutorial also discusses the emerging undoped or lightly-doped channel MOSFETs with performance comparable to FinFETs for design and manufacturing of smart IC products.},   keywords={MOSFET;Manufacturing;Logic gates;Integrated circuit modeling;Tutorials;Nanoscale devices},   doi={10.1109/SMELEC.2018.8481323},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

The plantar pressure is used to analyse pressure distribution. The signal from the pressure sensor will be processed by microcontroller and sent to mobile via Bluetooth module. With the help of Internet-of-Things (IoT), when the signal goes beyond the limit the notification will be sent to patient consulting the doctors/physiotherapist so that immediate action can be carried out further. The proposed system will help the doctors/physiotherapist as well as person to monitor his health using smart shoe. The device can help the clinician and the patient a tool to monitor and receive condition feedback.},   keywords={Bluetooth;body sensor networks;footwear;gait analysis;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;patient monitoring;patient rehabilitation;pressure sensors;gait analysis;metatarsal head;microcontroller;Bluetooth module;smart shoe;pressure sensor;sensor network;force sensing resistor sensor;electronic insole system;rehabilitation activities;lower body physical rehabilitation therapies;foot plantar pressure distribution;FSR sensor;foot pressure;IoT based monitoring;Foot;Monitoring;Force;Resistance;Pressure sensors;Footwear;Pressure measurement;Dynamic position;FSR sensor;In-sole shoe;IoT;Plantar pressure distribution;Rehabilitation;Static position},   doi={10.1109/ICCSP.2017.8286435},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Proper hand hygiene is the single biggest defense against spread of diseases and therefore the caregivers' compliance with hand hygiene is one of the most effective tools in preventing Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) in such institutions. In this paper, we present a system prototype of interconnected hand-hygiene stations that use a combination Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies for monitoring the hand hygiene compliance rate. The cloud-connected hand hygiene stations can cooperate to detect hand hygiene events in real-time, and help measuring the hand hygiene compliance at large-scale health-care facilities where it is deployed. The presented work is an initial phase of an on-going research study on hand hygiene compliance. Further phases of the system are currently being developed. The proposed system is desired to be scalable, and easy to install so that it can overcome most of the problems of existing related systems.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;monitoring;wireless sensor networks;monitoring;Internet of Things;public health institutions;hospitals;clinics;schools;nursing homes;bacterial diseases;caregiver compliance;healthcare associated infections;HAI;wireless sensor networks;WSN;IoT technologies;hand hygiene compliance rate;cloud-connected hand hygiene stations;hand hygiene events;health care facilities;Monitoring;Hospitals;Wireless communication;Radiofrequency identification;Wireless sensor networks;ZigBee;Hand-Hygiene compliance;infection control;Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks Internet-of-Things (IoT);Raspberry Pi},   doi={10.1109/ICIT.2017.7915560},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Fog Computing provides an architecture to satisfy those requirements through nodes located from near the “things” till the edge. The problem comes with the integration of the Fog nodes into current infrastructures. This process requires the development of complex software solutions and prevents Fog growth. In this paper we propose three innovations to enhance Fog: (i) a new orchestration policy, (ii) the creation of constellations of nodes, and (iii) Fog Function Virtualization (FFV). All together will complement Fog to reach its true potential as a generic scalable platform, running multiple IoT applications simultaneously.

 title={Automatic protocol configuration in single-channel low-power dynamic signaling for IoT devices}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Pulsed-Index Communication (PIC) is a novel technique for single-channel, high-data rate, low-power dynamic signaling that does not require any clock and data recovery. It is fully adapted to the simple yet robust communication needs of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors. However, its error-free operation with maximum data rate requires a careful and judicious setting of PIC data packet and pulse timing parameters. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for automatically detecting and setting the PIC protocol parameters at the power-on phase while removing the restriction on the IoT devices in the PIC network to communicate at a baud rate. The hardware realization of the algorithm is power-efficient and uses closed-form formulas that assign suitable protocol parameters to both ends of the transmission link based on clock rate differences. This difference is determined by a preliminary exchange of clock pulse streams between the transmitter and the receiver. The automatic parameter setting remains operational even in the presence of variations between the local clock frequencies of the IoT devices communicating via PIC. The algorithm is illustrated in the case of several IoT devices with different local clock frequencies that are in need to synchronize their communication parameters with respect to the clock frequency of a master gateway node. A power-on PIC parameter configuration process is rigorously specified, and both an FPGA and an ASIC implementations are presented. In particular, we show that for an ASIC implementation in 65nm technology, the low-power operation of PIC is maintained, consuming only 4.35μW of power at a clock frequency of 25MHz. This architecture is experimentally verified and tested on a point-to-point communication link between two IoT devices connected via a single PIC channel in a master-slave mode.},   keywords={application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;Internet of Things;low-power electronics;signalling protocols;synchronisation;automatic protocol configuration;single-channel low-power dynamic signaling;IoT devices;Internet of Things;PIC protocol parameters;pulsed-index communication;PIC network;baud rate;clock pulse streams;automatic parameter setting;local clock frequencies;master gateway node;FPGA;ASIC;point-to-point communication link;master-slave mode;power 4.35 muW;frequency 25 MHz},   doi={10.1109/VLSI-SoC.2016.7753560},   ISSN={2324-8440},   month={Sept},}

Current solutions are able to provide protection to patients' data during data transmission to some extent, but cannot prevent some sophisticated threats and attacks such as collusion attacks and data leakage. In this article, we first investigate the challenges with privacy protected data collection. Then we propose a practical framework called PrivacyProtector, patient privacy protected data collection, with the objective of preventing these types of attacks. PrivacyProtector includes the ideas of secret sharing and share repairing (in case of data loss or compromise) for patients' data privacy. Since it is the first time, we apply the Slepian- Wolf-coding-based secret sharing (SW-SSS) in PrivacyProtector. In the framework, we use a distributed database consisting of multiple cloud servers, which ensures that the privacy of patients' personal data can remain protected as long as one of the servers remains uncompromised. We also present a patient access control scheme in which multiple cloud servers collaborate in shared construction to offer patients' data to healthcare providers without revealing the content of the data. The privacy performance analysis has shown that the PrivacyProtector framework is secure and privacy-protected against various attacks.},   keywords={authorisation;computer network security;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;collusion attacks;data leakage;privacy protected data collection;patient privacy;data loss;patient access control scheme;healthcare providers;privacy performance analysis;PrivacyProtector framework;privacy-protected patient data collection;IoT;healthcare systems;medical devices;network devices;data transmission;cloud servers;security threats;Slepian-Wolf-coding-based secret sharing;Cryptography;Servers;Medical services;Data privacy;Maintenance engineering;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700364},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={Feb},}

Nowadays donor safety is major issue as blood is collected from different donors. Small amount of donors face reactions after donating blood and if not treated on time then it may lead to serious injury. The reactions that occur in the donor during blood donation at different hospitals and blood banks is collected, organized and analyzed by the DonorHART tool [1, 3]. The donor reactions information are captured and analyzed by DonorHART system[1]. The tool also monitors and researches the risks involved for donors at the time of blood donation or after the donation process. Data mining makes an effort to reveal the patterns in data that are difficult to detect and recognize with automatic pattern recognition. It is analyzing of data and then summarizing it into different form which is called as information and is taken from different databases.

For making IoT a reality, data produced by sensors, smart phones, watches, and other wearables need to be integrated; moreover, the meaning of IoT data should be explicitly represented. However, the Big Data nature of IoT data imposes challenges that need to be addressed in order to provide scalable and efficient IoT data-driven infrastructures. We tackle these issues and focus on the problems of describing the meaning of IoT streaming data using ontologies and integrating this data in a knowledge graph. We devise DESERT, a SPARQL query engine able to on-Demand factorizE and Semantically Enrich stReam daTa in a knowledge graph. Resulting knowledge graphs model the semantics or meaning of merged data in terms of entities that satisfy the SPARQL queries and relationships among those entities; thus, only data required for query answering is included in the knowledge graph. We empirically evaluate the results of DESERT on SRBench, a benchmark of Streaming RDF data. The experimental results suggest that DESERT allows for speeding up query execution while the size of the knowledge graphs remains relatively low.},   keywords={Big Data;data integration;graph theory;Internet of Things;merging;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query languages;query processing;knowledge graph;Streaming RDF data;semantic enrichment;Big Data nature;data merging;IoT stream data on-demand;Internet of Things;IoT data-driven infrastructures;ontologies;data integration;SPARQL queries;Resource description framework;Semantics;Temperature measurement;Ontologies;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Temperature sensors;Internet Of Things;Stream Data;Data Factorization;Semantification;Query Execution},   doi={10.1109/ICSC.2018.00014},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

 title={An architecture for customer experience management based on the Internet of Things}, 
  year={2014},   volume={58},   number={5/6},   pages={15:1-15:11},   abstract={In this paper, we propose a commerce-related architecture, the Smarter Commerce Customer Engagement Architecture (SCCEA). This architecture involves a new definition of the commerce lifecycle and an alternative metric for calculating customer experience and benefit, called customer lifetime benefit (CLB). Traditionally, commerce-related architectures have enabled the direct involvement and interaction between customers and companies from a purchasing, customer support center, or marketing perspective. These systems typically help measure financial success through the customer lifetime value (CLV) metric. SCCEA represents a shift in approaches from these architectures to one focused on the interactions with the products customers own and on how those products are operating. SCCEA analyzes the data gathered directly from the operations of products to make a determination of what actions can be taken to positively influence customer experience. SCCEA is realized through combining three foundational domains: Smarter Commerce™, Internet of Things, and Customer Engagement. The paper begins with a definition of the commerce lifecycle, followed by an overview of the three foundational domains.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2226-2233},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest Internet evolution that interconnects billions of devices, such as cameras, sensors, RFIDs, smart phones, wearable devices, ODBII dongles, etc. Federations of such IoT devices (or things) provides the information needed to solve many important problems that have been too difficult to harness before. Despite these great benefits, privacy in IoT remains a great concern, in particular when the number of things increases. This presses the need for the development of highly scalable and computationally efficient mechanisms to prevent unauthorised access and disclosure of sensitive information generated by things. In this paper, we address this need by proposing a lightweight, yet highly scalable, data obfuscation technique. For this purpose, a digital watermarking technique is used to control perturbation of sensitive data that enables legitimate users to de-obfuscate perturbed data. To enhance the scalability of our solution, we also introduce a contextualisation service that achieve real-time aggregation and filtering of IoT data for large number of designated users. We, then, assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique by considering a health-care scenario that involves data streamed from various wearable and stationary sensors capturing health data, such as heart-rate and blood pressure. An analysis of the experimental results that illustrate the unconstrained scalability of our technique concludes the paper.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;watermarking;scalable role-based data disclosure control;Internet of Things;smart health care;digital watermarking technique;IoT data aggregation;IoT data filtering;Watermarking;Access control;Data privacy;Correlation;Scalability;Privacy;Contextualization;Big Data;Scalability;Disclosure Control;Internet of Things;Security;Privacy},   doi={10.1109/ICDCS.2017.307},   ISSN={1063-6927},   month={June},}

Machine Learning on such streams allows for detection of patterns and prediction of activities which enables preventive care. Behavior patterns that lead to preventive care constitute a series of activities. Accurate labeling of activities is an extremely time-consuming process and the resulting labels are often noisy and error prone.

Low- cost, battery-operated, and resource-limited IoT devices usually are densely deployed for robustness against node failures as well as for providing desired quality of monitoring. One of the effective ways to prolong the lifetime of an IoT network is to schedule selected IoT devices to enter the sleep mode and activate them later in a future time. However, this must be done carefully in order not to violate application-specific requirements. In this paper, we study the scheduling problem of IoT devices to prolong the network lifetime while satisfying both report- accuracy and timely-update requirements. We model and analyze the network as a Markov process, and derive system parameters. We formulate an optimal node activation scheduling problem and propose a low-complex greedy algorithm to expedite the scheduling process. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both optimal and greedy algorithms.},   keywords={computer network reliability;energy conservation;greedy algorithms;Internet;Internet of Things;Markov processes;telecommunication scheduling;environment monitoring applications;IoT network;application-specific requirements;network lifetime;optimal node activation scheduling problem;energy-efficient scheduling problem;Internet of Things devices;sleep mode;Markov process;low-complex greedy algorithm;Monitoring;Markov processes;Internet of Things;Schedules;Analytical models;Scheduling;Greedy algorithms},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2018.8422174},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={620-624},   abstract={Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless communication technology for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although recent versions of BLE embrace the 6LoWPAN standard for IPv6 low-power device communication, this is often not the best choice for constrained-node networks due to downsides such as increased memory and computation overhead, heavier network stack, increased power consumption, backward incompatibility, etc. A crucial requirement for successful IoT solutions is an efficient strategy for monitoring and control of highly distributed sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and lightweight model for management of distributed constrained BLE nodes based on OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol. To this end, we have designed a new intermediate component, a BLE-LWM2M gateway (GW), which has dual roles: a BLE master that monitors and controls the BLE devices, and a LWM2M client that acts on behalf of an operator's LWM2M management server. The BLE-LWM2M GW has interfaces to dynamically manage connected BLE devices as LWM2M objects, called ObjectTwins, in runtime without a need for user configuration. All services that BLE devices provide are mapped to the ObjectTwins in the gateway, which are exposed to the LWM2M server. Hence, this model enables a LWM2M server to manage distributed BLE devices by interacting with the BLE-LWM2M GW using the LWM2M standard methods, and the constrained devices can still use a native Bluetooth communication protocol. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of a mobile healthcare system has been implemented in a testbed.},   keywords={Bluetooth;distributed sensors;Internet of Things;internetworking;personal area networks;protocols;wireless communication technology;IPv6 low-power device communication;constrained-node networks;computation overhead;distributed constrained BLE nodes;BLE master;LWM2M client;connected BLE devices;LWM2M objects;distributed BLE devices;LWM2M standard methods;constrained devices;native Bluetooth communication protocol;power consumption;distributed sensor nodes;dynamic management model;distributed Bluetooth low energy devices;lightweight management model;6LoWPAN standard;IoT solutions;OMA lightweight M2M protocol;BLE-LWM2M gateway;operator LWM2M management server;ObjectTwins;Servers;Bluetooth;Protocols;Monitoring;Logic gates;Internet;Wireless sensor networks},   doi={10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390355},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

With the increase in patient population, remotely prioritizing and diagnosing patients becomes a major problem. Research has been conducted to address this issue. However, many models fail to support the condition of comorbidity. In this paper, we developed a multi-task machine learning model that supports remote patient prioritization based on disease severity. This model not only considers patients diagnosed with a single disease, but also acknowledges comorbidity of a patient to calculate their severity utilizing physiological data. Classifying a comorbid patient based on their disease(s) severity is a challenging task. We achieve this by exploiting the commonalities and differences between the diseases using multi-task machine learning. Based on the correlation between diseases, we classify the patient into appropriate severity level. In addition to this, our model also supports continuous patient monitoring based on their severity levels, which is made possible by implementing in Apache Spark.

Interoperability for Telemedicine Systems can bring unprecedented value both at personal and at community level. In the other hand, the ability of sharing medical data on a global basis significantly extends the potential means of worldwide epidemic control. International disease analysis and the resulting forecasting-capabilities supported by Telemedicine Systems Interoperability represents a significant milestone in the practical application of various ICT-solutions, like cloud architecture, telecommunication systems, smart-devices and smartphone apps.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Deployment of internet of things (IoT) devices, wireless sensors, and sensor networks, in agriculture can be a great help in monitoring environment and growing crops; and having a network to support those devices is necessary to successfully utilize those resources. Recently, low-power wide area network (LPWAN) have been recognized as an appropriate technology for agriculture use. LoRa is a representative network of low-power wide area network (LPWAN). It can be applied to IoT for agriculture due to its long range and low power capabilities. LoRa network performance is highly affected by physical layer parameters and the environment. While LPWANs have been around for a number of years, they are still considered an emerging technology and have had few scientific studies performed. Currently, most studies have shown LoRa communication capabilities in urban, mountainous, and maritime areas, with little focus on agriculture use cases. Tree farming is a long-term investment, requiring careful monitoring to mitigate loss; therefore, this paper provides an analysis about the impact of variant physical layer parameters on performance of LoRa networks in a tree farm. Overall, the LoRa communication range was smaller than the theoretically expected range. Some PHY factors, spreading factor and coding rate, showed a clear impact on LoRa performance. Actual data reliability was inconsistent at varying distances and PHY configurations, unlike the consistency found in the RSSI reported by the radios. Additional experiments show the Fresnel Zone still affects LoRa networks. All experiments were performed in an Indiana rural tree plantation in the United States. Each node was set differently by modulating spreading factor, bandwidth and coding rate using 915MHz and 13 dBm transmit power at variant distance.},   keywords={crops;Internet of Things;telecommunication power management;wide area networks;wireless sensor networks;LoRa;internet of things devices;LoRa communication range;LoRa networks;tree farming;urban areas;low power capabilities;LPWAN;low-power wide area network;sensor networks;wireless sensors;IoT;tree farm;frequency 915.0 MHz;Encoding;Bandwidth;Vegetation;Agriculture;Logic gates;Fresnel reflection;Sensors;LoRa network;Tree farm;PHY factors;Fresnel zone;IoT;Precision Agriculture},   doi={10.1109/SAS.2018.8336764},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

This feature enhances the carrying capacity of wireless links and thus increases the overall network throughput. However, designing an efficient resource allocation strategy is a complex task due to the decisive behavior of interference. There is only a limited number of available channels; therefore, the resource allocation requires careful planning to mitigate the effect of interference. This research proposes a backtracking search-based resource allocation scheme that maps resource allocation to the constraint satisfaction problem. Some of the resource allocation constraints are applied as soft constraints which are relaxed to find a feasible solution, provided the perfect allocation of limited resources is not possible.

Moreover, a denoising framework based on the GL-SR is further given. In details, the noisy patches are firstly clustered into several categories to enhance the structure relationship among them. Then, the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian are obtained with the high-order ones carefully selected. A sparse model is sequently presented with these high-order eigenvectors as a regularization term. Finally, the proposed model is well solved by employing the solution of double sparse model.

In this sense, radio-channel characterization is essential; in particular, path-loss characterization allows to mathematically predict the propagation behavior and interferences of IoT devices with precision. In this paper, we show that by means of a set of mathematical corrections and measuring procedures, we can soundly employ the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), available in most IoT motes, to derive accurate path-loss models of industrial infrastructures.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={342-349},   abstract={Data-driven business processes are gaining popularity among enterprises now-a-days. In many situations, multiple parties would share data towards a common goal if it were possible to simultaneously protect the privacy of the individuals and organizations described in the data. Existing solutions for multi-party analytics require parties to transfer their raw data to a trusted mediator, who then performs the desired analysis on the global data, and shares the results with the parties. Unfortunately, such a solution does not fit many applications where privacy is a strong concern such as healthcare, finance and the internet-of-things. Motivated by the increasing demands for data privacy, in this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving multi-party analytics, where the goal is to enable analytics on multi-party data without compromising the data privacy of each individual party. We propose a secure gradient descent algorithm that enables analytics on data that is arbitrarily partitioned among multiple parties. The proposed algorithm is generic and applies to a wide class of machine learning problems. We demonstrate our solution for a popular use-case (i.e., regression), and evaluate the performance of the proposed secure solution in terms of accuracy, latency and communication cost. We also perform a scalability analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution as the data size and the number of parties increase.},   keywords={business data processing;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);trusted computing;privacy-preserving multiparty analytics;multiparty data;data privacy;individual party;data size;arbitrarily partitioned data;data-driven business processes;raw data;global data;enterprises;trusted mediator;internet-of-things;machine learning problems;secure gradient descent algorithm;Protocols;Cryptography;Data privacy;Organizations;Privacy;Machine learning algorithms;Hospitals;Multi-party Analytics;Privacy},   doi={10.1109/CLOUD.2017.51},   ISSN={2159-6190},   month={June},}

However, during an emergency incident, IoT devices have not been used to trigger emergency calls directly to healthcare providers mainly due to their constrained capabilities and lack of support session-oriented communications. Moreover, emergency services are currently offered by public safety stakeholders that do not support call triggering by IoT devices. This paper proposes IoTA framework which enables IoT devices to generate automatically emergency calls and support bi-directional communication sessions between healthcare providers and end users. The IoTA framework incorporates intelligent algorithms for processing and evaluating emergency events from various devices and performs emergency calls immediately after the occurrence of an event. The healthcare providers can interact with the IoTA framework requesting continuous real-time sensor data. A prototype implementation and initial evaluation results are presented as a proof of concept for people suffering from diverse chronic diseases.

This is difficult to achieve for unlicensed LPWAN technologies due to the crowded license free band. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), as a licensed LPWAN technology, is developed based on the existing long-term evolution specifications and facilities. Thus, it is able to provide cellular-level QoS, and henceforth can be viewed as a promising candidate for smart grid communications. In this paper, we introduce NB-IoT to the smart grid and compare it with the existing representative communication technologies in the context of smart grid communications in terms of data rate, latency, range, etc. The overall requirements of communications in the smart grid from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives are comprehensively investigated and each of them is carefully examined for NB-IoT. We further explore the representative applications in the smart grid and analyze the corresponding feasibility of NB-IoT.

But due to the remoteness of the areas, the follow up of patients has become a major challenge. In this work we propose an Internet of things based patient health monitoring system as a solution to afore mentioned problem. The system monitors vital health parameters of a patient and uploads the data to server using a software based gateway. The data is processed real-time and doctor is alerted when anomalies are detected. There is provision for bi-directional data flow, allowing the doctor to send clinical advice to the patient. The system was tested in a rural healthcare unit and real-time data was generated. The results were confirmed by qualified medical practitioner.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;internetworking;medical computing;patient monitoring;software based gateway;distributed flow environment;medical IoT;rural areas;India;health care facilities;Internet of things based patient health monitoring system;vital health parameters;bidirectional data flow;clinical advice;rural healthcare unit;real-time data;Medical services;Servers;Smart phones;Databases;Temperature sensors;Wireless fidelity;IoT;Distributed intelligence;Software gateway;Open WRT Linux;REST},   doi={10.1109/ANTS.2016.7947858},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

 title={SmartCityWare: A Service-Oriented Middleware for Cloud and Fog Enabled Smart City Services}, 
  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={17576-17588},   abstract={Smart cities are becoming a reality. Various aspects of modern cities are being automated and integrated with information and communication technologies to achieve higher functionality, optimized resources utilization, and management, and improved quality of life for the residents. Smart cities rely heavily on utilizing various software, hardware, and communication technologies to improve the operations in areas, such as healthcare, transportation, energy, education, logistics, and many others, while reducing costs and resources consumption. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT provides a platform for linking the cyber parts of a smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the smart city, including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water networks, hospitals, and other resources. Another useful technology is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable localized and real-time support for operating-enhanced smart city services. However, proper integration and efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing is not an easy task. This paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware (SOM) approach can help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart city services using CoT and Fog Computing. We propose an SOM called SmartCityWare for effective integration and utilization of CoT and Fog Computing. SmartCityWare abstracts services and components involved in smart city applications as services accessible through the service-oriented model. This enhances integration and allows for flexible inclusion and utilization of the various services needed in a smart city application. In addition, we discuss the implementation and experimental issues of SmartCityWare and demonstrate its use through examples of smart city applications.},   keywords={cloud computing;middleware;smart cities;town and country planning;CoT;SOM approach;Cloud of Things;service-oriented middleware;optimized resource utilization;SmartCityWare;cloud computing paradigm;communication technologies;operating-enhanced smart city services;Fog Computing;Smart cities;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Smart city;Cloud of Things;Internet of Things;cyber physical systems;middleware;service-oriented middleware;cloud computing;fog computing},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2731382},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Gamification of physics themes to nurture engineering professional and life skills}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={931-939},   abstract={Gamification is a new generation tool for engaging students at different levels of education, motivating them to achieve the expected learning outcomes with greater ease. The fun element of gamification invites students to playfully engage and appropriate the concepts they learn at a higher level of educational achievement as stipulated in the Bloom's Taxonomy of Education. Further, the next generation students of engineering are expected to master their profession at a superior level in order to be able to match the requirements of future workspace, which are expected to be fully technology-driven, making the content of their learning subservient to the skills they imbibe. Hence they need to be equipped with adequate professional and life skills, which prepare them to easily adapt to the fast changing global job scenarios of the future. With the advance of industrial revolution version 4.0, powered by Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and 3-D printing, large number of jobs that demands human intervention is systematically delegated to the modern machines. Such paradigm shift in manufacturing in particular and engineering in general anticipates that the future engineers will need to equip themselves both in professional and life skills, so that their career as engineers and technologists are not critically challenged by the modern technology invasion. It will push future engineers to further focus on their human core-competence, which may not easily be taken over by autonomous machines. These changes will necessarily bring a paradigm shift in engineering education too, making many of the contemporary practices redundant. Creative thinking skills are expected to reign supreme. Along with that the conflict resolution skills, communication skills, team work, etc. will also assume importance. Correspondingly, engineering education has to be re-imagined, supporting the contemporary requirements of professional development of the students of engineering. The current paper reports some concepts developed in view of gamification of various themes and concepts related to Engineering Physics taught at Rajagiri School of Engineering &amp;amp; Technology, India. A novel approach of identification of the action verb behind a physical concept, prior to the development of appropriate games, is suggested in this paper, whereby students are allowed to experientially appropriate the concept behind the physical concept playfully. Care is also taken to develop games that will simultaneously cater to the development of both the professional and personal skills of the engineering students. Thus, gamification is visualized here as a project to engineer a deeper and experiential understanding of the physical concepts as well as to nurture the required skills of modern students of engineering, simultaneously. The paper does not present games that are fully developed. Rather, it presents a novel approach towards developing games based on themes of Engineering Physics, meant for developing better understanding of those concepts and at the same time aid the development of soft-skills, values and attitudes suitable for a successful life and career of an engineer.},   keywords={computer aided instruction;educational courses;engineering education;human factors;innovation management;serious games (computing);team working;gamification;physics themes;generation tool;engaging students;expected learning outcomes;higher level;educational achievement;generation students;superior level;future workspace;fully technology;adequate professional life skills;fast changing global job scenarios;industrial revolution version 4;demands human intervention;modern machines;paradigm shift;future engineers;modern technology invasion;human core-competence;engineering education;creative thinking skills;conflict resolution skills;communication skills;contemporary requirements;professional development;Engineering Physics;Engineering &amp; Technology;physical concept;appropriate games;professional skills;personal skills;engineering students;modern students;Games;Oscillators;Physics;Engineering profession;Object recognition;Engineering education;Gamification;Action Verbs;Physical Phenomena;Skill Development;Professional Skills;Personal Skills},   doi={10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363330},   ISSN={2165-9567},   month={April},}

  year={2010},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Recently the problem of providing effective and appropriate healthcare to elderly and disable people is an important field in relative to the aging of population problems. The objective of information and communication technologies (ICT) is to focus on the new technologies the medical environments, so that it can provide management to accelerate and improve the clinical process. Our contribution is to introduce an approach based on Internet of things (IoT) in medical environments to achieve a global connectivity with the patient, sensors and everything around it. The main goal of this globality feature is to provide a context awareness to make the patient's life easier and the clinical process more effective. To achieve this approach, firstly has been developed an architecture which has been designed to offer great potential and flexibility of communications, monitoring and control. This architecture includes several advanced communication technologies; among them are 6LoWPAN and RFID/NFC, which are the basis of the IoT. Moreover the research deal with the problems related to the mobility and security that happens when IoT is applied in medical environments. The mobility issue requires developing a protocol over 6LoWPAN network to be carried out in sensor networks with high specification related with low power consumption and capacity. While in the RFID/NFC technologies need to support secure communications, our proposal is to introduce a set of security techniques and cryptographic SIM card to authenticate, encrypt and sign the communications with medical devices. The preliminary results showed a reduction of time in the handover process with the protocol for mobility defined, by omitting the stages of addressing and simplifying the MIPv6 protocol. In addition to increase the security in the communications carried out by NFC devices enhanced with the inclusion of cryptographic SIM card.},   keywords={cryptography;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;Internet;mobile computing;patient care;protocols;radiofrequency identification;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;healthcare;elderly people;disable people;information and communication technologies;ICT;clinical process;Internet of things;context awareness;patient life;6LoWPAN network;RFID technology;NFC technology;secure communications;cryptographic SIM card;authentication;MIPv6 protocol;sensor networks;mobility;Internet;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Communications technology;Radiofrequency identification;Information security;Medical services;Senior citizens;Aging;Environmental management},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421661},   ISSN={2331-9852},   month={Jan},}

This paper focuses on the IaaS aspects of robotic applications as cloud computing services. It proposes an architecture that enables cost efficiency through virtualization and dynamic task delegation to robots, including robots that might belong to other clouds. Overlays and RESTful Web services are used as cornerstones. A prototype is built using LEGO Mindstorms NXT as the robotic platform, and JXTA as the overlay middleware.

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1463-1468},   abstract={Data security is one of the biggest concerns in adopting Cloud computing. Cloud Computing moves the application software and databases to the large data centres, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges which have not been well understood. In Cloud environment, users remotely store their data and relieve themselves from the hassle of local storage and maintenance. However, in this process, they lose control over their data. Existing approaches do not take all the facets into consideration viz. dynamic nature of Cloud, computation &amp;amp; communication overhead etc. In this paper, we propose a Data Storage Security Model to achieve storage correctness incorporating Cloud's dynamic nature while maintaining low computation and communication cost. Encryption key management has become table stakes for cloud vendors, The ability to bring your own encryption keys is fast becoming ubiquitous in public cloud, but that doesn't mean IT pros should retain control. Security concerns and data center oversight are two primary hang-ups for IT shops averse to adopting public cloud. Amazon became the first major infrastructure as a service (IaaS) vendor to offer bring your own key encryption in 2014 as an answer to some of those critiques. Over the past few weeks, Microsoft and Google have also advanced their cloud encryption key management capabilities. Vendors at every layer of the cloud stack have added encryption capabilities, and, eventually, all cloud vendors will offer some form of encryption and key management. Some vendors will opt to do it natively, while others will pass the control to customers so they can check off that box on their list of capabilities.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer centres;cryptography;bring your own encryption;BYOE;secure data storage;cloud databases;data security;cloud computing;data centres;security challenges;cloud environment;computation overhead;communication overhead;data storage security model;encryption key management;cloud vendors;IT shops;Amazon;infrastructure as a service vendor;IaaS;Google;Microsoft;cloud encryption key management capabilities;Cloud computing;Encryption;Organizations;Law;Cloud encryption key management;Bring Your Own Key (BOYK);Bring Your Own Encryption (BOYE);Bring Your Own Decryption (BYOD);Public Cloud Encryption;Securing Cloud Data at Rest},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380698},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Complex IoT services are increasingly composed of sensors, devices, and compute resources within fog computing infrastructures. The orchestration of such applications can be leveraged to alleviate the difficulties of maintenance and enhance data security and system reliability. However, efficiently dealing with dynamic variations and transient operational behavior is a crucial challenge within the context of choreographing complex services. Furthermore, with the rapid increase of the scale of IoT deployments, the heterogeneity, dynamicity, and uncertainty within fog environments and increased computational complexity further aggravate this challenge.

In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.},   keywords={computer network security;Internet of Things;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks;wireless mesh routing protocol;DoS attacks;IoT-based ambient assisted living applications;Internet of things;wireless mesh network;denial of service attacks;data packet delivery ratio;Routing protocols;Routing;Computer crime;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Ambient Assisted Living;Denial of Service;eHealthcare;Internet of Things;Network Layer Attacks;Routing Protocol;Security;Wireless Mesh Network},   doi={10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454499},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={IoT for AAL: An Architecture via Information-Centric Networking}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems have become a main part in future internet research. In IoT, heterogeneous devices are connected to sense the environment or to observe special tasks. Many research fields use the seamless IoT infrastructure to interact between the integrated devices and diverse services. Considering the healthcare research, the number of elderly people is rapidly growing and they need more support in their life. Therefore, a new technology called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has been proposed to better increase the life quality of elderly people. In AAL, the devices are mostly connected wirelessly to each other and/or to a healthcare service centre. It is challenging to build such a system and its deployment should be seamless and flexible. Therefore, IoT provides all main characteristics necessary for AAL environment and applications, including heterogeneous devices. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory. Recently, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been established as a best communication paradigm for future internet, particularly in IoT. Based on hierarchically structured names, ICN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and provides an efficient and intelligent communication paradigm for both IoT and AAL (IoT-AAL) technologies. In this work, we design an IoT architecture for AAL via ICN approach which will effectively improve the performance of communication between the heterogeneous devices and services integrated in IoT-AAL.},   keywords={assisted living;geriatrics;Internet;Internet of Things;heterogeneous services;IoT-AAL;intelligent communication paradigm;heterogeneous devices;elderly people;healthcare research;future Internet research;ICN;information-centric networking;ambient assisted living;AAL environment;Internet-of-things systems;IoT systems;Internet;Sensors;Routing;Monitoring},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414020},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;cardiology;data acquisition;electrocardiography;entropy;feature extraction;health care;health hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;medical signal processing;neural nets;patient monitoring;pattern matching;real-time systems;signal classification;telemedicine;Web services;personalized healthcare;wearable systems;real-time ECG Classification;wearable biomedical devices;potential health hazards;timely medical treatment;modern wearable health monitoring devices;real-time analyses;ECG readings;arrhythmia classification;ECG waveforms;ECG equipment;machine learning phase;unique feature extraction method;prediction models;neuralnet fitting models;k-NN Classification models;misclassification error value;wearable devices;3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit;tele health analytical server;prediction tasks;trained classification models;ECG abnormalities;abnormal ECG events;Electronic Health Record;health care;cure institutions;Electrocardiography;Heart;Real-time systems;Databases;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Feature extraction;ECG classification;Wearable IoT;preventive health-care;real-time ECG;arrhythmia detection;arrhythmia Neural-Net;MITDB;Physionet;GP Connect;HL7;FHIR},   doi={10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

These are biosensors for testing of blood, saliva, and breath. Bibliometrics and patent analysis of these biosensors are used to develop technology maturity rates based on the Fisher-Pry model. The Science Citation Index (SCI) is used for bibliometrics and patent analysis is derived from global patent databases. The Fisher-Pry projections or S-curves enable insights into the maturity levels of the emerging biosensor technologies under consideration and forecasting their growth. Patent analysis based on cumulative annual patent count indicated that blood biosensors reached their technology maturity midpoint in 2009 with the midpoints of saliva and breath biosensors lagging by 8 and 14 years respectively.

Therefore, it is very important to capture the security requirements at conceptual level in order to identify the security needs in the first place.

 title={Secure Healthcare Data Dissemination Using Vehicle Relay Networks}, 
  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={In the recent years, vehicular adhoc networks (VANETs) can be an attractive choice for collecting and transferring the healthcare data of the passengers to the remote healthcare centers. In VANETs, some of the intermediate nodes may act as relay nodes in which case, these networks are called as vehicular relay networks (VRNs). However, the transmitted information in VRNs can be captured by intruders during transmission. Moreover, an attacker can launch selective forwarding, blackhole and sinkhole attacks in the network, which may in turn degrade the network performance parameters like high end-to-end delay, low packet delivery ratio and network throughput. Hence, to address these issues, a secure data dissemination scheme using VRNs is proposed. In the proposed scheme, firstly, a secure vehicular medical relay network system is designed for the users belonging to disconnected rural areas. The collected information is filtered at zonal levels before transmission to a nearby road side units (RSUs), which further pass it to the incoming vehicles. Secondly, a secure passenger health monitoring network is designed which continuously monitors health services of the passengers traveling in different vehicles. The information collected through small body sensors installed in the vehicles act as data sets that is forwarded to the on-board monitoring unit within the vehicle. This collected data is then transmitted to centralized healthcare centers for processing by using VRNs. Lastly, a strong Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based cryptographic solution is designed for secure communication among different vehicles. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in various network scenarios with respect to different selected parameters, such as throughput, network delay, packet delivery ratio, jitter, transmission and computation overheads, and key distribution overhead. The obtained results indicate that the proposed scheme provides improvement of 52% in average delay and 5% in packet delivery ratio. This further indicates effective message delivery even with high mobility of the vehicles.},   keywords={Medical services;Data dissemination;Monitoring;Relay networks (telecommunications);Cryptography;Electronic mail;Vehicular relay network;Healthcare;Data dissemination;ECC;Body sensor networks;Security.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2865008},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

In this work, a frontal collision has been considered and a new approach called IoT based collision avoidance system (IoT-CAS) is introduced for identifying the trains on the same track. A vibration sensor is placed at the end of each branch for identifying the arrival and departure of the train in the particular branch. The IoT-CAS automatically updates the status of the track in the cloud. If an arrival signal is received from both the endpoints a caution message is sent to both the driver with audio and visual effect. Accordingly, IoT-CAS manages the situation and also identifies the train which is on the same track.

Several identification and tracking technologies, wireless sensor and actuator networks, distributed intelligence and other enhanced communication techniques are put together to establish IoT framework. Communication protocols and routing strategies in these mesh-like sensor networks should be carefully designed to cope up with the fast changing nature of the topology. This paper tries to propose a protocol in the real time network where the traffic is more and also congested by so many data sources sending their packets to the base station at the same time. The protocol selects the path with a high survivability factor at the same time it should try to select the one which has less interference from the other nodes as well as the environment. For selecting the next hop node, our algorithm uses a criterion which is a function of the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio of the link between those two, survivability factor of the path from that node to the destination, and the path loss distance from that node to the destination.},   keywords={interference (signal);Internet of Things;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;dynamic survivable path routing;fast changing IoT network;wireless sensor;actuator networks;distributed intelligence;IoT framework;communication protocols;future communication networks;communication techniques;next hop node;signal-to-interference-noise-ratio;Routing;Interference;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks;Signal to noise ratio;Network topology;IoT, WSN, Network Survivability, Path Survivability Factor, Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio, path loss distance to Sink},   doi={10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00024},   ISSN={2324-9013},   month={Aug},}

Each device gathers data and uploads it to servers via communication networks. Servers store the large volumes of received data in databases. Applications analyze this data and extract valuable information. Finally, based on this information, new services (in domains such as smart cities, public safety, e-commerce, medical, healthcare, or automobile) are provided. In this data flow, systems and applications in the upper layer trust the hardware in the lower layer, which includes data-gathering devices. If the collected information is intentionally modified by adversaries, services in the upper layer could be disrupted. Therefore, to ensure service continuity in the IoT, it is important to secure the hardware layer in which data are harvested and transmitted.

Meanwhile, Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) have proved themselves to be promising tools for driving and managing devices within IoT systems. However, past works have not fully addressed how the IoT-based BPMS can continue their execution when the involved IoT devices do not have a reliable Internet connection. In this paper, we propose a system design for decentralised device-to-device (D2D)-based BP execution, where mobile nodes have the capability of both executing BPs but also migrating BP execution to other nodes during runtime. We apply this design to the field of smart logistics, in order to enable smart goods monitoring. The presented goods monitoring solution enables reacting to events as soon as they occur, while also generating a trace of the monitoring execution history. A prototype focusing on the migration functionality of the platform has been implemented and tested to evaluate its performance in the context of the mentioned smart logistics scenario.},   keywords={Internet;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communication;WiseWare;industrial Internet of Things;device-to-device-based business process management system;IoT-enabled information system;healthcare;smart logistics;agriculture;BPMS;Internet connection;decentralised D2D-based BP execution;mobile nodes;smart goods monitoring;Monitoring;Transportation;Sensors;Logistics;History;Companies;Internet of Things;Business Process Management Systems;Business Process Migration;Device-to-Device;Goods Monitoring;Smart Logistics},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.69},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={This work proposes an ultralow power highly linear analog front-end (AFE) with an input dynamic range from 200μVpp to 20mVpp. The system consists of a signal conditioning instrumentation amplifier (IA), two programmable gain amplifiers (PGA), a mixed signal automatic gain control (AGC), two sample and hold (S/H), a 10 bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converter (ADC), and a ΣΔ modulator with 10 bit effective number of bits (ENOB). A highly linear capacitively-coupled IA is achieved by increasing its feedback factor. Moreover, a transconductance (gm) cancellation technique is proposed for achieving a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The conditioned signal is digitized using a SAR ADC for an input range of 200μVpp to 2mVpp, and, an opamp-shared ΣΔ ADC for an input range of 2mVpp to 20mVpp. The selection between the two ADCs is done by the AGC. The full system is designed using 1V supply in UMC 0.18μm CMOS technology. The AFE (IA and the two PGAs) achieves an overall linearity of more than 12 bits, for an input range of 200μVpp to 20mVpp while consuming 300nW with a bandwidth of 0.05 - 250Hz. The power consumption of the SAR ADC is 40nW while operating at a sampling frequency of 1KHz. The ΣΔ ADC consumes 300nW at a sampling frequency of 32KHz with an OSR of 32. The proposed system is intended to be powered by an energy scavenging circuit without compromising its own performance.

For example, a wearable system provides unobtrusive ambulatory, continuous, ubiquitous health measurement, and real-time solution for patients physical without hampering the natural movement of the wearer. However, the ability to measure one’s Automatic Nervous System (ANS) using wearable biosensors in healthcare applications has been limited due to several challenges related to a lack in wearability, accuracy, reliability and low-power consumption. In this paper, we presented a novel wearable ring sensor for the continuous measurement of four ANS activities: Electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, skin temperature and locomotion. Detailed information is given regarding the development of the proposed ring sensor followed by a discussion of the evaluation that was done utilizing the wearable sensor on volunteers to gather data. Specifically, volunteers wore the ring sensor while being simultaneously monitored with real-time telemetry, the sensor values are processed and analyzed. This paper is a continuation and extension of earlier work by the authors. New validation, experimental results and development of the mobile application have been added to improve the previous system. The experiment demonstrated accurate results, and data were collected from 43 participants of diverse age, body mass, height, and race. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of the developed ring sensor, we compared the results with a state-of-the-art open source device.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={7-12},   abstract={Wearable and connected health is a dominant field in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). Indeed, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been widely used for enabling many connected health applications in diverse areas including: activity recognition, elder care, sports, and rehabilitation. Although the number of transistors in an integrated circuit follows Moore's law, it does not apply to batteries. Thus, in BSNs, the sensor node's compact size means it has a strict energy constraint. At the same time, body sensor nodes have sensing requirements that should provide an acceptable level of data fidelity in order to accurately infer the amount and type of activity. This paper investigates the energy challenges associated with combining MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and ball-tube motion detectors for BSNs. We examine multiple scenarios using these sensor types for body motion characterization. We then investigate the feasibility of these technologies along with collaborative sensing with the aim of reducing overall energy consumption. We conducted experiments examining sedentary (i.e. no movement) and non-sedentary activities. Our results show the possibility of 67 % reduction in energy consumption during the sedentary periods only, while maintaining the required level of data fidelity for inferring motion types.},   keywords={biomedical measurement;bioMEMS;body sensor networks;Internet of Things;motion measurement;fidelity-energy trade-off;wireless body sensor networks;wearable health;connected health;Internet of Things;IoT;activity recognition;elder care;sports;rehabilitation;Moore's law;data fidelity;MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units;ball-tube motion detectors;non-sedentary activities;Sensors;Energy consumption;Accelerometers;Wireless sensor networks;Batteries;Wireless communication;Collaboration;Motion sensing;Data fidelity;Energy consumption;Accelerometer;Ball-tube;Collaborative sensing},   doi={10.1109/CHASE.2017.52},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

The global passenger traffic is expected to grow steadily in the coming years. This growth in traffic thus calls for a corresponding increase in the comfort and service provided to passengers on-board a railway train. In this paper, we propose CARE, an Internet of Things (IoT) based system for catering to passenger services and requests in railway trains. The system leverages the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to track the location of crew members (mobile resources) within a train. An On-line Proximity-Aware Mobile (OPAM) multi-objective resource allocation algorithm has been devised which on the basis of service arrival time, location information and workload factor, allocates crew members to the requests from the passengers. We have experimentally evaluated the performance of our approach and found it to be far better than the conventionally used purely centralized method.

However, little research has been done in to investigate the IoT potential for seniors with chronic diseases and special needs, such as dementia and Alzheimer patients. It is crucial for decision makers, such as health care services providers, governments, clinics, etc., to be able to assess different types of IoT applications in relation to the specific nature of dementia. This paper utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and attempts to develop a multicriteria model in order to evaluate the potential of various IoT technologies applications in dementia care. Six IoT-based healthcare services were selected and compared against two conventional services (i.e. family-based healthcare and assisted living facility), in terms of their effectiveness, safety and patient perspectives. An AHP questionnaire was structured and data was collected and analysed from a group of 12 experts in dementia, who had previously agreed to participate in this study. The results indicate the potential of IoT technologies. However, the importance of conventional dementia care services is still highly appreciated. The design and development of IoT-based services for dementia patients should take into consideration the fact that cognitive dysfunction is an obstacle for using new technologies, thus further development is necessary and new functionality need to be implement for the IoT to be competitive.},   keywords={analytic hierarchy process;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;multicriteria evaluation;Internet of Things;IoT;dementia care;chronic diseases;special needs;analytic hierarchy process;AHP;health care services;Dementia;Industries;Medical diagnostic imaging;Monitoring;Sensors;Internet of Things;e-Health;Dementia care;Assisted Living;Multicriteria evaluation},   doi={10.1109/CBI.2017.34},   ISSN={2378-1971},   month={July},}

This paper proposes Content-Centric networking based framework over 5G as the primary enabler for E-health applications. If users of wireless body area network (WBAN) use IP network, they face many issues such as packet loss, security etc. So, Content-Centric network (CCN) is proposed to solve such problems with exploitation many advantages like efficient resource management, scalability, reduction of traffic and security. CCN router has the caching capability to cache the contents. In this way, users of CCN-based WBAN do not need to directly connect with the hospital server to access patient data.

In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1× and 7.8× were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18% for lossy and 53% for lossless transmission respectively. Options for hybrid transmission mode, adaptive rate selection and system level power reduction make the proposed scheme attractive for IoT wireless sensors in healthcare applications.},   keywords={biomedical communication;Bluetooth;data compression;electrocardiography;entropy codes;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;radio transceivers;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks;hybrid data compression scheme;power reduction;IoT wireless sensors;data transmission scheme;Internet-of-Things;hybrid transmission mode;adaptive data rate selection;wireless transmission;electrocardiogram;ECG;lossy compression technique;compression ratio;decompressed lossy data;entropy coding;lossless compression;Bluetooth transceiver;lossless transmission;healthcare applications;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Electrocardiography;Propagation losses;Hybrid power systems;Data compression;Hybrid compression;internet-of-things;lossless;lossy;wearable devices;wireless sensors;Algorithms;Data Compression;Databases, Factual;Electrocardiography;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wireless Technology},   doi={10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2591923},   ISSN={1932-4545},   month={April},}

Proposed system is all about context aware middleware for Human Activity Recognition. The main idea of activity recognition is to recognize day to day common human activities in real life. As human activities are complex and highly diverse activity recognition is challenging task. Activity recognition means to analysis of human body activity.

By employing real-time e-health monitoring systems for acquiring, and analyzing bio-signals by measurements such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), it is possible to extract information to achieve better health-care in terms of observation, diagnosis, and treatment. However, those systems are limited in acquiring and sending data at high rates, are not energy efficient, or, are restricted in terms of portability due to large size and weight. In this paper, a compact portable bio-signal acquisition device for wearables has been designed and implemented. The developed hardware is capable of acquiring and reliably sending the data wirelessly at a high transfer rate in real-time while keeping the overall energy consumption low. Finally, the signal acquisition performance of the device has been evaluated for both ECG and EMG at 8 channel 24 bit resolution/channel 500 samples/s configuration. Measurement of energy consumption has been conducted using professional tool and it is found that the device can continuously work for up to 13.6 hours with a 3.7V 1700 mAh battery.

Since traditional recognition technology adopts a single wireless link, it is effective to identify whether an individual stays in a certain area. However, the technology fails to effectively recognize high-level human motions such as falling and lying down, which is of great importance for home health care for elders and rescue for fire buildings. To solve this problem, we put forward an experimental model with two layer wireless links to facilitate human motion recognition. After presenting relevant feasibility analysis, we conducted simulation experiments and applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the recognition of human motions. Experimental results show that the model makes a satisfactory performance in the recognition of the four human motions: walking, standing, lying down and normal state.},   keywords={motion estimation;radio links;wireless sensor networks;passive human motion recognition;two-layer wireless links;wireless sensor network;high-level human motions;falling;lying down;home health care;elders;rescue;fire buildings;support vector machine;SVM;walking;standing;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Support vector machines;Legged locomotion;Kernel;Accuracy;Educational institutions;human motion recognition;two-layer wireless links;SVM},   doi={10.1109/iThings.2014.48},   ISSN={},   month={Sept},}

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is one of the technologies aspiring to a standard in the IoT world. CoAP was designed to provide a low-overhead, machine-to-machine communication for constrained devices in a way similar to HTTP. In this paper we propose a solution, which enables non-routable and legacy sensor networks to utilize the CoAP protocol and integrate with a centralized database. The CoAP protocol is used in an “inversed” fashion, where a node acts as a client, that is actively publishing the data rather than serving it on demand. Even though this model seems contrary to the “Web of Things” idea, we find it useful for certain network types, in which nodes may not be directly accessible, for example networks containing nodes with long sleep periods or networks not based on the IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN standards. The presented solution was initially implemented for the needs of the project RADCARE<sup>1</sup>.

  year={2015},   volume={2},   number={1},   pages={63-71},   abstract={Body area networks (BANs) consisting of small sensing and computing devices can help to improve medical care and well-being of humans. Obviously, the data recorded in BANs such as vital parameters are personal and should be private. To protect this privacy, such data are usually encrypted when transmitting it over a wireless link. In the past, many cryptographic algorithms and methods for the encryption and decryption of data have been proposed-and most of them have become obsolete. One-time pads (OTPs) were mathematically proven to be secure and impossible to crack. But, for most purposes, OTPs are complicated to handle, because if applied correctly, for each bit of plain text data, another bit of OTP must be available. Sensors in BANs usually do not generate an enormous amount of data. Hence, also the length of an OTP is not huge. Sustained progress in memory technology makes large amounts of nonvolatile memory available at cheap prices and small sizes. Thus, numerous OTPs can be preinstalled on BAN devices and ensure a long lasting and secure data transmission. In this paper, we present a concept for securing data transmission in BANs by utilizing OTPs. We delineate a system for generation, distribution, and utilization of OTPs in wireless sensor network (WSN) and BAN scenarios, and we show the implementation and evaluation of such a system.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;wireless sensor networks;body area networks;BAN;secure data transmission;medical care;wireless link;cryptographic algorithms;one-time pads;memory technology;wireless sensor network;WSN;Encryption;Wireless sensor networks;Intelligent sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless sensors networks;Medical devices;Medical services;Computer security;Privacy;Body area networks;Security;Privacy;Encryption;Wireless Sensor Networks;Body Area Networks;One-Time Pad;Body area networks (BANs);encryption;one-time pad (OTP);privacy;security;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2378783},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

This paper describes the Elderly Monitoring service - an IoT module of the SOCIALIZE platform, whose aim is to collect environmental and physical user data so that they can be supervised by medical and caregiver staffs. The system has been designed to enable easy addition and/or substitution of new services and devices within the environment. To this end, the service implements a framework that enables heterogeneous devices belonging to different domotic systems and protocols to directly share data, thereby implementing an infrastructure suitable for the fulfillment of a real Social IoT (SIoT).},   keywords={geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;social networking (online);elderly life quality improvement;Social Internet of Things;SIoT;older adults;public health systems;information and communication technologies;ICT;integrated healthcare services;elderly homecare;cost reduction;SOCIALIZE AAL project;Elderly Monitoring service;IoT module;SOCIALIZE platform;environmental user data;physical user data;medical supervision;caregiver staffs;domotic systems;protocols;data sharing;Social IoT;Senior citizens;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Social network services;Statistics;Medical services;SIoT;IoT;Interoperability;SOA;SOCIALIZE;AAL;Smart Home},   doi={10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016215},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

However, DNN models, especially a convolutional neural network (CNN), usually involve massive parameters and are computationally expensive, making them extremely dependent on high-performance hardware. This prohibits their further extensions, e.g., applications on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a quantized CNN, a unified approach to accelerate and compress convolutional networks. Guided by minimizing the approximation error of individual layer's response, both fully connected and convolutional layers are carefully quantized. The inference computation can be effectively carried out on the quantized network, with much lower memory and storage consumption. Quantitative evaluation on two publicly available benchmarks demonstrates the promising performance of our approach: with comparable classification accuracy, it achieves 4 to 6× acceleration and 15 to 20× compression.

One critical IoT application pertains to m-Health services which allow monitoring the health status of patients while providing the ability for a rapid response in emergency cases. Connecting healthcare services to the IoT brings forward new security threats and vulnerabilities that can jeopardize the patients' private data. In this paper, a novel security framework for m-Health IoT security is proposed using the concept of moving target defense (MTD). MTD allows the m-Health system to dynamically change its cryptographic keys to increase uncertainty on an attacker and secure the data. In the proposed scheme, the devices update their keys locally to eliminate the risk of revealing new keys while they are being shared with a gateway. A practical implementation is proposed based on bitslicing LED, a lightweight encryption cipher, to improve the performance of decrypting multiple packets at the same time. LED bitsliced implementation was tested on an ARM Cortex-A53 and was shown to consume half of the processor's instructions compared to the conventional implementation. The effect of applying MTD on the number of processor's instructions is evaluated and shown to be bounded.},   keywords={cryptography;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;Internet of Things;security threats;cybersecurity;m-Health IoT security;novel security framework;healthcare services;emergency cases;m-Health services;networked services;LED bitslice implementation;m-Health IoT systems;conventional implementation;LED bitsliced implementation;bitslicing;practical implementation;cryptographic keys;m-Health system;MTD;Encryption;Logic gates;Light emitting diodes;Performance evaluation;Internet},   doi={10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326298},   ISSN={2158-4001},   month={Jan},}

While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features.

  year={2017},   volume={4},   number={6},   pages={22-32},   abstract={Emerging availability (and varying complexity and types) of Internet of Things devices, along with the large data volumes that such devices (can potentially) generate, can have a significant impact on our lives, fueling the development of critical next-generation services and applications in a variety of application domains (e.g., health care, smart grids, finance, disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and water management). Deep learning technology, which has been used successfully in computer vision and language modeling, is finding application in new domains driven by the availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction that use deep learning technology to improve human health. However, timely and reliable transfer of large data streams (a requirement of deep learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralized locations, such as cloud datacenter environments, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including osmotic computing, have been proposed that promote distribution of data analysis tasks across cloud and edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge, and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner. This Blue Skies piece analyzes the research challenges involved with developing a class of holistic distributed deep learning algorithms that are resource and data aware and are able to account for underlying heterogeneous data models, resource (cloud vs. edge vs. mobile edge) models, and data availability while executing-trading accuracy for execution time, etc.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer centres;data analysis;data models;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;data streams;cloud datacenter environments;osmotic computing;data analysis tasks;edge computing environments;mobile edge environments;holistic distributed deep learning algorithms;heterogeneous data models;data availability;critical next-generation services;Internet of Things devices;Blue Skies;Machine learning;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Data models;Biological system modeling;Mobile communication;Distributed databases;deep learning;osmosis;holistic;cloud IoT;distributed},   doi={10.1109/MCC.2018.1081070},   ISSN={2325-6095},   month={November},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={5939-5953},   abstract={Smart Healthcare is envisioned as the combination of traditional healthcare augmented by smart bio-sensors, wearable devices, and a plethora of on-body sensors that communicate with smart hospitals, smart emergency response systems, and ambulances, through advanced information and communication technologies. The vision of smart healthcare as part of a smart city relies on the framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the underlying core technology that enables the design and operation of a city, whereby smart technology, energy grids, transportation, buildings, communication, and information technology, are all interconnected. This paper addresses some of the challenges faced in the IoT infrastructure, specifically secure communication and user authentication in the context of automated analysis of biomedical images and communication of the analysis results and related metadata in a smart healthcare framework. A hardware architecture for a secure digital camera integrated with the secure better portable graphics (SBPG) compression algorithm, suitable for applications in the IoT, is proposed in this paper. The focus of this paper is on patient data protection and authentication. The proposed SBPG architecture offers two layers of protection, concurrent encryption and watermarking, which address all issues related to security, privacy, and digital rights management. The experimental results demonstrate that the new compression technique BPG outperforms JPEG in terms of compression quality and compressed file size while providing increased image quality. High performance requirements of BPG have been met by employing two techniques: 1) insertion of an encrypted signature in the center portion of the image and 2) frequency-domain watermarking using blockwise DCT of size 8 × 8 pixels. These approaches optimize the proposed architecture by decreasing computational complexity while maintaining strong protection, with concomitant increase of the speed of the watermarking and compression processes. A Simulink® prototype for the proposed architecture has been built and tested. To the best of our knowledge, the hardware architecture for BPG compression with built-in image authentication capability for integration with a secure digital camera is the first one ever proposed.},   keywords={cryptography;data compression;data privacy;discrete cosine transforms;emergency services;health care;image coding;image watermarking;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;trustworthy media communications;traditional healthcare;smart bio-sensors;on-body sensors;smart hospitals;smart emergency response systems;smart city;smart technology;information technology;IoT infrastructure;smart healthcare framework;hardware architecture;secure digital camera;patient data protection;SBPG architecture;privacy;compression technique BPG;compression quality;compressed file size;watermarking;compression processes;BPG compression;image authentication capability;secure portable graphics compression algorithm;image quality;secure communication;Medical services;Watermarking;Digital cameras;Image coding;Computer architecture;Smart healthcare;Internet of Things (IoT);consumer electronics;secure digital camera;image communications;better portable graphics},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2795478},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Among several such devices, GPUs have attracted attention in the past, mainly because the high computing demand of packet processing applications can, potentially, be satisfied by these throughput-oriented machines. However, another important aspect of such applications is the packet latency which, if not handled carefully, will overshadow the throughput benefits. Unfortunately, until now, this aspect has been mostly ignored. To address this issue, we propose a method that considers the variable bit rate of the traffic and, depending on the current rate, minimizes the latency, while meeting the rate demand. We propose a persistent kernel based software architecture to overcome the challenges inherent in GPU implementation like kernel invocation overhead, CPU-GPU communication and memory access overhead. We have chosen packet classification as the packet processing application to demonstrate our technique. Using the proposed approach, we are able to reduce the packet latency on average by a factor of 3.5, compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, without any packet drop.},   keywords={graphics processing units;Internet;Internet of Things;parallel processing;persistent objects;software architecture;CPU-GPU heterogeneous systems;high computing demand;throughput-oriented machines;persistent kernel based software architecture;latency-aware packet processing;Internet of Things;time-to-market general-purpose devices;high-performance computing;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Throughput;Instruction sets;Software architecture;Parallel processing;Hardware},   doi={10.1145/3061639.3062269},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Whilst bioengineering has brought about seeds with much higher yield and less need for water and nutrients, it is only now with IoT that farmers can work on the intensive use of natural resources to increase the sustainability of their operations. In the last ten years, high-end machinery has evolved primarily to the benefit of larger corporations, with the introduction of satellite driven machines, sensors and all components of precision farming. The most recent IoT advances bring about a level of simplification and cost reduction that enable all farmers to benefit and a true adoption of prescription agriculture. In this conference presentation, we will examine a practical case of a Malthouse, where careful modeling of how CO2, Temperature, Humidity and PH vary in the three steps of the malting process, enabled an artificial intelligence system to prescribe different setting and schedules. The end result is malt with higher content of starch and proteins, which in turn means higher alcohol in the downstream process.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Cloud-Assisted Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) is one of the key emerging technology for medical applications in the era of Internet-of-Things. In cloud-assisted WBANs, the WBANs are able to access the cloud resources, which are geographically close to the local Access Points (APs). However, in the presence of poor radio link-quality between cloud-assisted WBANs and APs, energy consumption and service delay of the network dynamically changed. In order to solve this problem, we propose an energy-efficient Body-to-Body (B2B) communications among coexisting WBANs to relay the information of the patients to APs to provide real-time healthcare services. On the other hand, the healthcare services enabled for cloud-assisted WBANs is popularly known as Healthcare-as-a-Service (He-aaS). In He-aaS, it is very challenging to finalize a price agreement between WBANs and H-CSPs as WBANs follow a heterogeneous architecture. The existing pricing mechanisms, which are constrained to the homogeneous applications, are not compatible to He-aaS. We propose an optimal and dynamic pricing policy for He-aaS in order to increase the profit level of each WBAN with the consideration of the optimal QoS and energy. Extensive results indicate that our proposed schemes are able to efficiently utilize limited resource with optimal QoS and energy consideration.},   keywords={Cloud computing;Pricing;Body area networks;Medical services;Computer architecture;Wireless communication;Delays;Wireless Body Area Networks;Cloud-Assisted B2B Communication;QoS;Distributed Pricing Policy},   doi={10.1109/TSC.2018.2841914},   ISSN={1939-1374},   month={},}

For cost efficiency and backward compatibility with legacy transceiver hardware, a simple approach to address interference is by appropriately configuring the carrier sensing thresholds in wireless CSMA protocols, particularly in dense wireless networks. Most prior studies of the configuration of carrier sensing thresholds are based on a simplified conflict graph model, whereas this paper considers a realistic signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio model. We provide a comprehensive study for two effective wireless CSMA protocols: Cumulative-interference-Power Carrier Sensing and Incremental-interference-Power Carrier Sensing, in two aspects: (1) static approach that sets a universal carrier sensing threshold to ensure interference-safe transmissions regardless of network topology, and (2) adaptive approach that adjusts the carrier sensing thresholds dynamically based on the feedback of nearby transmissions.

Meanwhile, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed to improve the system spectral efficiency (SE) of the fifth-generation (5G) networks by allowing concurrent transmissions of multiple users in the same spectrum. As such, NOMA has been recently considered for the uplink of WPCNs based IoT networks with a massive number of devices. However, simultaneous transmissions in NOMA may also incur more transmit energy consumption as well as circuit energy consumption in practice which is critical for energy constrained IoT devices. As a result, compared to orthogonal multiple access schemes such as time-division multiple access (TDMA), whether the SE can be improved and/or the total energy consumption can be reduced with NOMA in such a scenario still remains unknown. To answer this question, we first derive the optimal time allocations for maximizing the SE of a TDMA-based WPCN (T-WPCN) and a NOMA-based WPCN (N-WPCN), respectively. Subsequently, we analyze the total energy consumption as well as the maximum SE achieved by these two networks. Surprisingly, it is found that N-WPCN not only consumes more energy, but also is less spectral efficient than T-WPCN. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and unveil the fundamental performance bottleneck, i.e., “worst user bottleneck problem”, in multiuser NOMA systems.},   keywords={Internet of Things;telecommunication power management;time division multiple access;energy-efficient wireless powered IoT networks;wireless powered communication networks;future Internet-of-Things;nonorthogonal multiple access;system spectral efficiency;concurrent transmissions;WPCNs based IoT networks;simultaneous transmissions;transmit energy consumption;circuit energy consumption;orthogonal multiple access schemes;time-division multiple access;total energy consumption;TDMA-based WPCN;NOMA-based WPCN;multiuser NOMA systems;multiple energy-limited devices;energy constrained IoT devices;NOMA;Energy consumption;Wireless communication;Time division multiple access;Throughput;Resource management;IEEE transactions;Spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, wireless power IoT networks, NOMA, TDMA},   doi={10.1109/TVT.2018.2799947},   ISSN={0018-9545},   month={July},}

 title={Calorie Map: An Activity Intensity Monitoring System Based on Wireless Signals}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Recently, elder care services, especially for those with chronic diseases, have become an important application in the field of IoT. Several studies have reported that the progress of chronic diseases can be slowed down effectively by moderate physical activities. In this paper, we propose an activity intensity monitoring system to support continuous monitoring of indoor calorie consumption. The system uses wireless signals to infer calorie burned in walking. In the proposed system, Bluetooth smart beacons are deployed in various spaces of a house. The elders who wear smart wristbands are continuously monitored for their locations by received wireless signals. The system has the following features. First, it utilizes wireless signals as location and activity intensity indicators; inertial sensors are only used in the training stage.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={645-649},   abstract={Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a prevalent cause of death and disability with over 3.8 million annual cases and 130 daily deaths in the United States alone. Whenever athletes suffer head trauma, concussion field tests that measure their perceptiveness and cognitive abilities are commonly administered. However, these tests have limited accuracy due to the lack of quantitative data basing the diagnosis, and often those administering concussion tests feel pressured to keep athletes playing in the game despite cognitive impairment. To solve this, an inexpensive diagnostic helmet targeting youth sports teams was created, providing quantitative data regarding how much head trauma an athlete has experienced. The helmet is connected to a web-based application system that stores real time data regarding the impact of the head injury, the region of the brain impacted, the time of injury, and speed at which the injury occurred, allowing for the design of more patient-tailored treatment plans. The device and web application were programmed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Node.js platform in the Intel Edison IoT IDE. Once the force sensitive resistors register an impact significant enough to cause a concussion based upon an algorithm that takes into consideration the player's height and weight, a text message is automatically sent to local paramedics through the Twilio API. This device therefore removes existing bias involved in diagnostics, allows doctors to more accurately handle injuries, and helps ensure player safety.},   keywords={brain;cognition;diseases;embedded systems;injuries;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical disorders;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;sport;Web services;traumatic brain injury diagnosis;disability;athlete;head trauma;cognitive abilities;cognitive impairment;inexpensive diagnostic helmet;web-based application system;head injury;patient-tailored treatment plans;web application;Intel Edison IoT IDE;JavaScript;HTML;CSS;Node.js platform;Force;Brain injuries;Head;Sensors;Acceleration;Resistors;Consumer electronics;Applied engineering;Mechatronics;Healthcare electronics;Medical electronics;Intel Edison;Wireless computing;Patient care;Internet of Things;Application;SMS;Traumatic Brain Injury},   doi={10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249087},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Smart cities heavily rely on utilizing a number of technologies to improve the performance and services in healthcare, transportation, energy, education, and many others, while reducing costs and resource consumption. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of Things (CoT). CoT can provide a platform for linking the cyber parts of the smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the smart city including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water networks, hospitals and other physical resources. Another technology that can be utilized for enhancing smart cities services is Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network to enable better support for operating enhanced services. However, proper integration and efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing for smart cities is not an easy task. The paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware approach can help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart city services using CoT and Fog Computing.

The Virtual Traffic Light (VTL) system is envisioned to replace or to complement physical traffic lights in order to reduce costs and to optimize the road traffic flow in urban environments. VTL, developed at Carnegie Mellon University, outlines the general capabilities of such a system. The VTL system heavily relies on coordinating clusters of cars and the communication among them. We developed a DSRC/WAVE based communication protocol for the management of these clusters, carefully investigating all the networking aspects related to this management and the communication between the cluster leaders. Comparing VTL to physical traffic lights, we are able to show a speedup of up to 35% in realistic environments.

This article discusses the potential of future high-accuracy localization systems as a key component of AL applications. Accurate location information can be tremendously useful to realize, e.g., behavioral monitoring, fall detection, and real-time assistance. Such services are expected to provide older adults and people with disabilities with more independence and thus to reduce the cost of caretaking. Total cost of ownership and ease of installation are paramount to make sensor systems for AL viable. In case of a radio-based indoor localization system, this implies that a conventional solution is unlikely to gain widespread adoption because of its requirement to install multiple fixed nodes (anchors) in each room. This article therefore places its focus on 1) discussing radiolocalization methods that reduce the required infrastructure by exploiting information from reflected multipath components (MPCs) and 2) showing that knowledge about the propagation environment enables localization with high accuracy and robustness. It is demonstrated that new millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technology, under investigation for 5G communications systems, will be able to provide centimeter (cm)-accuracy indoor localization in a robust manner, ideally suited for AL.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;assisted living;handicapped aids;multipath channels;radionavigation;sensor placement;assisted living technology;multipath channels;AL technology;Internet of Things;high-accuracy localization systems;location information;caretaking cost reduction;total cost of ownership;sensor systems;radio-based indoor localization system;reflected multipath components;MPCs;millimeter-wave technology;mm-wave technology;5G communications systems;centimeter-accuracy indoor localization;aging society;propagation environment;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Robustness;Delays;Covariance matrices;Mathematical model;Assisted living;Assistive technology},   doi={10.1109/MSP.2015.2504328},   ISSN={1053-5888},   month={March},}

Also a critical issue of using D2D assisted cellular networks under a healthcare scenario is the electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by RF transmission, and a high level of EMI may lead to a critical malfunction of medical equipments. In consideration of CTI and EMI, we study the problem of optimizing individual channel rates of the mobile users in different priorities (different levels of emergency) within the Internet of Vehicles for mobile health, and propose an algorithm of controlling the transmit power to solve the above-mentioned problem under a game-theoretical framework. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can converge linearly to the optimum, while ensuring an allowable level of EMI on medical equipments.},   keywords={biomedical communication;cellular radio;electromagnetic interference;Internet;power control;telecommunication control;user-priority-based power control;D2D assisted internet;mobile health;device-to-device assisted cellular network;cellular communications;cross-tier interference;D2D assisted cellular networks;electromagnetic interference;EMI;game-theoretical framework;Electromagnetic interference;Injuries;Device-to-device communication;Cellular networks;Resource management;Mobile computing;Device-to-device (D2D);electromagnetic interference (EMI);Internet of Vehicles;mobile health (M-health);power control},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2671424},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

According to CISCO, IoT can be considered as a situation or time where more things are connected to internet than human beings. Things represent the physical objects which are provided with unique identification numbers and their purpose is to collect and transmit the data which are relevant to the scenario in which things are placed. From building and home automation to wearable, the IoT touches every facet of our lives. Many corporates are making heavy investment in using IoT as a solution in Healthcare field. With help of intelligent systems one can obtain the life critical data from patients and by making appropriate use of these data improves the efficiency of health care industry. The data collected from patient is extremely sensitive so along with revolutionizing patient care proper security measures have to be taken to safeguard connected devices and networks in the Internet of things. The intelligent system includes different bio-medical sensors and the data collected using these sensors will be small in size and frequent in transmission, so the encryption technique to be followed should be of lightweight scheme. In modern world of cryptography the new protocols are moving away from RSA to Elliptic Curve. The wide acceptance of ECC is due to its light-weight computation nature. In order to implement the concept of IoT we can use many wireless technologies among them the core technology used in IoT deployments in the health care environment is Radio Frequency Identification. In RFID system, proper authentication has to be performed between RFID tags and RFID reader. In this paper describes a authentication scheme which performs authentication between RFID tag and RFID reader with help of a server which contains some pre shared information about tag and reader.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;patient care;radiofrequency identification;RFID based security platform;Internet of Things;health care environment;computer network field;CISCO;IoT;intelligent systems;patient care;biomedical sensors;encryption technique;Elliptic Curve;Radio Frequency Identification;RFID tags;Medical services;Authentication;Elliptic curve cryptography;IoT;ECC},   doi={10.1109/GET.2016.7916693},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

However, while many individuals claim to care about privacy, they are often perceived to express behaviour to the contrary. This phenomenon is known as the Privacy Paradox and its existence has been validated through numerous psychological, economic and computer science studies. Several contributory factors have been suggested including user interface design, risk salience, social norms and default configurations. We posit that the further proliferation of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) will aggravate many of these factors, posing even greater risks to individuals' privacy.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-15},   abstract={This paper proposes a cyber-physical framework for vision-based automated vehicle path tracking. The framework has been developed in two parts: first, an intelligent relative vehicle displacement approach with an adaptive neural network controller; and second, multisampling data transmission architecture for any sensor–controller–actuator network. Uncertainties due to illumination effects, occlusion, and obscure images affect system performance drastically. The proposed relative vehicle displacement approach takes care of these uncertainties. The adaptive neural network controller generates precise control actions for stabilizing the system in minimum time. A reliable and robust data transmission architecture is of utmost importance for any Internet of Things application. Successful data transmission depends on several parameters, such as delay, communication channel behavior, and packet loss. A novel multisampling data transmission architecture addressing these issues has been proposed in this paper. Various cases of data transmission have been demonstrated on the time critical application of vision-based tracking by an automated guided vehicle. The results of real-time path tracking operation have been duly compared with other control techniques and data transmission architecture.

  year={2018},   volume={26},   number={2},   pages={779-792},   abstract={Wireless object-tracking applications are gaining popularity and will soon utilize emerging ultra-low-power deviceto-device communication. However, severe energy constraints require much more careful accounting of energy usage than what prior art provides. In particular, the available energy, the differing power consumption levels for listening, receiving, and transmitting, as well as the limited control bandwidth must all be considered. Therefore, we formulate the problem of maximizing the throughput among a set of heterogeneous broadcasting nodes with differing power consumption levels, each subject to a strict ultra-low-power budget. We obtain the oracle throughput (i.e., maximum throughput achieved by an oracle) and use Lagrangian methods to design EconCast-a simple asynchronous distributed protocol in which nodes transition between sleep, listen, and transmit states, and dynamically change the transition rates. EconCast can operate in groupput or anyput mode to respectively maximize two alternative throughput measures. We show that EconCast approaches the oracle throughput. The performance is also evaluated numerically and via extensive simulations and it is shown that EconCast outperforms prior art by 6×-17× under realistic assumptions. Moreover, we evaluate EconCast's latency performance and consider design tradeoffs when operating in groupput and anyput modes. Finally, we implement EconCast using the TI eZ430-RF2500-SEH energy harvesting nodes and experimentally show that in realistic environments it obtains 57%-77% of the achievable throughput.},   keywords={energy harvesting;power consumption;protocols;ultra-low-power constraints;severe energy constraints;careful accounting;energy usage;heterogeneous broadcasting nodes;oracle throughput;maximum throughput;nodes transition;alternative throughput measures;EconCast's latency performance;achievable throughput;power consumption levels;ultra-low-power budget;broadcast throughput maximization;Wireless object-tracking applications;ultra-low-power device-to-device communication;asynchronous distributed protocol;TI eZ430-RF2500-SEH energy harvesting nodes;Throughput;Power demand;Protocols;Wireless communication;Energy harvesting;IEEE transactions;Art;Internet-of-Things;energy harvesting;ultra-low-power;wireless communication},   doi={10.1109/TNET.2018.2805185},   ISSN={1063-6692},   month={April},}

One of the approaches is to monitor the health state of the patient and screen it to doctors or paramedical staff through the IoT, as it is hard to screen the patient for 24 hours. So here the patient health condition or status i.e. Pulse rate, Respiratory rate, Body Temperature, Position of the body, Blood glucose, ECG and so on can be measured by utilizing the Non-invasive sensors. These sensors are associated with the Arduino Uno board, it gathers the information i.e. biomedical data from the sensors and the detected biomedical information can be transmitted to the server. The “Thingspeak” named new cloud is utilized here to place the detected information into the server. From this server the information can be envisioned to the specialists and other paramedical staff by Thingspeak android app. In this way by utilizing this Smart health monitoring system diminishes the exertion of specialists and paramedical staffs to screen the patient for 24 hours and furthermore lessens the time and cost of support.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;blood;body sensor networks;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sugar;paramedical staff;IoT;patient health condition;Noninvasive sensors;detected biomedical information;Smart health monitoring system;smart home mechanization;savvy urban areas;smart environment;patient health monitoring system;health state;Arduino Uno board;Thingspeak android app;biomedical information;biomedical data;ECG;body position;blood glucose;time 24.0 hour;Temperature sensors;Heart beat;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Clouds;Internet of Things (IoT);Arduino Uno;Thingspeak},   doi={10.1109/I-SMAC.2017.8058240},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

Billions of things are expected to be a part of IoT paradigm in the near future, providing enormous applications ranging from home automation, smart environment, health care, etc. One of the major hurdles for IoT to be effective with existing network architectures is a prolonged and seamless connectivity between the things and with the end user. Due to heterogeneity in the characteristics of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it has become a most prominent technology to bind the things with the Internet and with the end users. Wireless Sensor Networks are self healing and active in nature, that is, they can sense, instruct, request, respond and can easily be adopted to Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN). Addressing scheme in Wireless Sensor networks has to be foreseen if it has to be deployed in Internet of Things paradigm.

Given the limitations of the interconnected resource-constrained devices, the execution environment can be based on an appropriate operating system for the IoT. The development effort can be reduced, when applications are built on top of RESTful web services, which can be shared and reused. However, the asynchronous communication between remote nodes is prone to event scheduling delays, which cannot be predicted and taken into account while programming the application. Long delays in message processing and communication, due to packet collisions, are avoided by carefully choosing the data transmission frequencies between the system's nodes. But even when specialized simulators are available, it is still a hard challenge to guarantee the functional and non-functional requirements at the application and system levels. In this article, we introduce a model-based rigorous analysis approach using the BIP component framework. We present a BIP model for IoT applications running on the Contiki OS.

As one of the most sophisticated IoE applications, real-time video analytics is promising to significantly improve public safety, business intelligence, and healthcare &amp; life science, among others. However, cloud-centric video analytics requires that all video data must be preloaded to a centralized cluster or the cloud, which suffers from high response latency and high cost of data transmission, given the scale of zettabytes of video data generated by IoE devices. Moreover, video data is rarely shared among multiple stakeholders due to various concerns, which restricts the practical deployment of video analytics that takes advantages of many data sources to make smart decisions. Furthermore, there is no efficient programming interface for developers and users to easily program and deploy IoE applications across geographically distributed computation resources. In this paper, we present a new computing framework,<i>Firework</i>, which facilitates distributed data processing and sharing for IoE applications via a virtual shared data view and service composition.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a powerful tool for endowing computers with the capacity to process information about the affective states of users in human-machine interactions. Recent research has shown the effectiveness of graph embedding based subspace learning and extreme learning machine applied to SER, but there are still various drawbacks in these two techniques that limit their application. Regarding subspace learning, the change from linearity to nonlinearity is usually achieved through kernelisation, while extreme learning machines only take label information into consideration at the output layer. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper leverages extreme learning machine for dimensionality reduction and proposes a novel framework to combine spectral regression based subspace learning and extreme learning machine. The proposed framework contains three stages - data mapping, graph decomposition, and regression. At the data mapping stage, various mapping strategies provide different views of the samples. At the graph decomposition stage, specifically designed embedding graphs provide a possibility to better represent the structure of data, through generating virtual coordinates. Finally, at the regression stage, dimension-reduced mappings are achieved by connecting the virtual coordinates and data mapping. Using this framework, we propose several novel dimensionality reduction algorithms, apply them to SER tasks, and compare their performance to relevant state-of-the-art methods. Our results on several paralinguistic corpora show that our proposed techniques lead to significant improvements.},   keywords={Training;Emotion recognition;Optimization;Task analysis;Dimensionality reduction;Neurons;Speech recognition;Speech emotion recognition;extreme learning machine;subspace learning;graph embedding;spectral regression},   doi={10.1109/TMM.2018.2865834},   ISSN={1520-9210},   month={},}

Smart devices can directly interact with the human beings for sensing the healthcare parameters and transmitting to a central repository. During the data exchange, it is mandatory to secure the messages between sender and receiver to handle the malicious human based attacks. For providing secure communication, a number of signature-based schemes are explored in literature but smart devices need more lightweight operations by ensuring desired security strengths. The main problem during signature based approaches is the computational overhead due to large real numbers required for signature and verification processes. This paper presents a light weight shortened complex digital signature algorithm for providing secure communication between smart devices in human centered IoT. We have used less extensive operations to achieve signature and verification processes like human beings do signatures on legal documents and verify later as per witness. We have also presented a multi-option parameter selection to use a signature-verification pair of expressions at particular index by adopting the common practice of human beings for using different signatures as per document criticality level. It enhances the security strength to guard against traffic analysis attacks. We have developed an experimental setup where a number of cell phones and smart devices are considered for secure communication using existing and proposed digital signature schemes.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Internet of Things is a new technology which offers enormous applications that make people’s lives more convenient and enhances cities’ development. In particular, smart healthcare applications in IoTs have been receiving increasing attention for industrial and academic research. However, due to the sensitiveness of medical information, security and privacy issues in IoTs healthcare systems are very important. Designing an efficient secure scheme with less computation time and energy consumption is a critical challenge in IoTs healthcare systems. In this paper, a lightweight online/offline certificateless signature (L-OOCLS) is proposed, then a heterogeneous remote anonymous authentication protocol (HRAAP) is designed to enable remote WBANs users to anonymously enjoy healthcare service based on the Internet of Things applications. The proposed L-OOCLS scheme is proven secure in random oracle model and the proposed HRAAP can resist various types of attacks. Compared with the existing relevant schemes, the proposed HRAAP achieves less computation overhead as well as less power consumption on WBANs client. In addition, to nicely meet the application in the IoTs, an application scenario is given.},   keywords={Authentication;Internet of Things;Medical services;Elliptic curve cryptography;Public Key Infrastructure;Certificateless Cryptography;Remote Authentication;Anonymity;Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs);Internet of Things (IoTs).},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876133},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

Technologies such as 5G, edge computing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things realize smart healthcare that a client can have anytime, anywhere, and in real time. Edge computing offers useful computing resources at the edge of the network to maintain low-latency and real-time computing. In this article, we propose a smart healthcare framework using edge computing. In the framework, we develop a voice disorder assessment and treatment system using a deep learning approach. A client provides his or her voice sample captured by smart sensors, and the sample goes to the edge computing for initial processing. Then the edge computing sends data to a core cloud for further processing. The assessment and management are controlled by a service provider through a cloud manager. Once the automatic assessment is done, the decision is sent to specialists, who prescribe appropriate treatment to the clients. The proposed system achieves 98.5 percent accuracy and 99.3 percent sensitivity using the Saarbrucken Voice Disorder database.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical disorders;patient diagnosis;patient treatment;real-time computing;edge computing;voice disorder assessment;cloud computing;voice disorder treatment;smart healthcare framework;deep learning;Saarbrucken Voice Disorder database;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Medical treatment;Real-time systems;Task analysis;5G mobile communication;Smart healthcare},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700790},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={APRIL},}

Furthermore, motivated by IoT, studies of local distributed mobile devices attract attentions of both industry and academia in recent years. However, existing storage systems cannot manage data and support the QoS of mobile services well. This paper presents LKSM, a light weight key-value storage system, which can be deployed on either one node or multiple nodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to propose key-value store in this scenario. We carefully analyze the challenges when designing the system on mobile cluster, and further propose RDS for addressing. With the help of RDS, LKSM achieves the goal of lower latency, better scalability, and higher availability.

The purpose of this paper is to study a nonpreemptive scheduling problem on a single-machine to minimize the total tardiness and total energy cost under time-of-use electricity tariffs, which is a mixed-integer multi-objective mathematical programming model. To achieve these objectives, we develop several new holistic genetic algorithms. The proposed model is solved via several methods including weighted sum method and multiobjective genetic algorithms based on dominance rank (GA-1), weighted sum aggregation (GA-2), dominance ranking procedure and crowding distance comparison (GA-3), and heuristic approach (GA-H). This paper illustrates that operations management, which is typically observed as a significant technique that allows manufacturing to operate in challenging data enabled environment in an industrial internet of things ecosystem, can also carefully optimize a production process to improve energy cost in order to manage environmental challenges. Thus, the findings provide information on when to start each job. We provide detailed experimental results evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms.

A Raspberry Pi, a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) device, is responsible for sensing the temperature and streaming it to a server, the readings then are displayed in a mobile android application. For this system, a python application was developed to sense and stream the temperature, a servlet was developed to read and store the temperature in a SQLite database, and a mobile Android application was developed to read and display the temperature readings from the server. The initial versions of the project used the SoC device as a server (storing temperature readings into a local SQLite database), and both the SoC device and the mobile device needed to be connected in a local area network. However, the project was further developed to separate the server responsibilities from the SoC device. The system now supports user authentication, and both devices are connected through the Internet. This implementation allows the temperature readings to be viewed and displayed anytime from anywhere in the world since the database is hosted on a server which can be accessed over the internet. Also, this solution allows multiple SoC devices to stream temperatures to the server, to different mobile clients using the same database. The Android client application was also implemented to graphically show the temperature readings recorded by Raspberry Pi using Restful architecture. Moreover, an alert message notification was implemented in Android application so that a user is notified whenever the temperature reading reaches the preset threshold.

Since MC is directly inspired by communication processes in biological cells, the engineering of biological circuits through cells' genetic code manipulation, which enables access to the cells' information processing abilities, is a candidate technology for the future realization of MC components. In this paper, inspired by previous research on channel coding schemes for MC and biological circuits for cell communications, a joint encoder and modulator design is proposed for the transmission of cellular information through signaling molecules. In particular, the information encoding and modulation are based on a binary parity check scheme, and they are implemented by interconnecting biological circuit components based on gene expression and mass action reactions. Each component is mathematically modeled and tuned according to the desired output.

However, in order to fully exploit the applications facilitated by M2M communications, adequate support from all layers in the network stack must first be provided in order to meet their service requirements. This paper presents a survey of the requirements, technical challenges, and existing work on medium access control (MAC) layer protocols for supporting M2M communications. This paper first describes the issues related to efficient, scalable, and fair channel access for M2M communications. Then, in addition to protocols that have been developed specifically for M2M communications, this paper reviews existing MAC protocols and their applicability to M2M communications.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1327-1336},   abstract={The rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds great promise to transform people's lives by making society more efficient in many areas, including energy, transportation, healthcare, commerce, manufacturing, etc. At their core, IoT devices use sensors to collect data on real-world physical processes and then transmit it over the Internet to cloud servers, which store, process, and learn from the data to better optimize these processes, either directly (by issuing remote commands that actuate IoT devices) or indirectly (by issuing notifications that direct users to take some action). Unfortunately, IoT devices also expose users to multiple new types of privacy attacks. In particular, the sensor data collected from IoT devices can indirectly reveal a variety of sensitive private information. In addition, users generally connect IoT devices to local networks, which they implicitly trust, with little understanding of what the IoT device is doing on the network. In this visionpaper, we discuss recent work on sensor data privacy in the context of smart energy systems to provide examples of i) the surprising types of private information we can glean from seemingly innocuous IoT data and ii) the different types of defenses we have developed to preserve IoT data privacy for smart energy systems. These defenses lie at different discrete points in the tradeoff between user privacy and IoT functionality, which motivates ongoing work on developing defenses that provide a more tunable tradeoff. We also discuss the privacy implications of connecting tens-to-hundreds of untrusted IoT devices to implicitly trusted local networks, and avenues for research to mitigate these concerns.},   keywords={cloud computing;data privacy;Internet;Internet of Things;untrusted IoT devices;IoT device;IoT data privacy;user privacy;IoT era;Internet-of-Things;cloud servers;privacy attacks;sensor data privacy;smart energy systems;Sensors;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Privacy;Privacy, Security, Internet of Things, Energy Systems, Smart Home, Smart Health},   doi={10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00133},   ISSN={2575-8411},   month={July},}

This paradigm shift, while bringing numerous benefits and new opportunities to healthcare organizations, has raised a lot of security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation.

The WSNs and IoT enable EMGdi information telemonitoring and communications technologies play important roles in the process of personal medical care, especially for the respiratory diseases. However, while designing such a system, one should consider the required functionality, miniaturization, energy efficiency, etc., to make fewer resources required in WSNs and IoT. Conventional methods of data acquisition cannot energy-effectively compress data with reduced device costs. Different from the traditional compression methods, compressed sensing (CS) takes promising steps toward these challenges. Unfortunately, EMGdi is not sparse in time domain. Hence, current CS algorithms are extremely difficult to use directly for recovering EMGdi. In order to satisfy the requirements of applications of personal medical care in WSNs and IoT, this study proposes an approximated ι<sub>0</sub>norm based method to search the solution via the gradient descent method, then projects the searched solution to the reconstruction feasible set.

Therefore, interoperability is one of the most fundamental requirements for IoT systems.

 title={Packet Size Optimization for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks Aided Internet of Things}, 
  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={6325-6344},   abstract={Cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs) is the state-of-the-art communication paradigm for power constrained short range data communication. It is one of the potential technologies adopted for Internet of Things (IoT) and other futuristic machine-to-machine-based applications. Many of these applications are power constrained and delay sensitive. Therefore, CRSN architecture must be coupled with different adaptive and robust communication schemes to take care of the delay and energy efficiency at the same time. Considering the tradeoff that exists in terms of energy efficiency and overhead delay for a given data packet length, it is proposed to transmit the physical layer payload with an optimal packet size (OPS) depending on the network condition. Furthermore, due to the cognitive feature of CRSN architecture overhead energy consumption due to channel sensing and channel handoff plays a critical role. Based on the above premises, in this paper, we propose a heuristic exhaustive search-based Algorithm-1 and a computationally efficient suboptimal low complexity Karuh-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition-based Algorithm-2 to determine the OPS in CRSN architecture using variable rate m-QAM modulation. The proposed algorithms are implemented along with two main cognitive radio assisted channel access strategies based on distributed time slotted-cognitive medium access control (DTS-CMAC) and centralized common control channel-based cognitive medium access control (CC-CMAC) and their performances are compared. The simulation results reveal that proposed Algorithm-2 outperforms Algorithm-1 by a significant margin in terms of its implementation time. For the exhaustive search-based Algorithm-1 the average time consumed to determine OPS for a given number of cognitive users is 1.2 s, while for KKT-based Algorithm-2, it is of the order of 5-10 ms. CC-CMAC with OPS is most efficient in terms of overall energy consumption but incurs more delay as compared to DTS-CMAC with OPS scheme.},   keywords={cognitive radio;Internet of Things;optimisation;quadrature amplitude modulation;packet size optimization;cognitive radio sensor networks aided Internet of Things;Internet of Things;CRSN architecture;optimal packet size;channel sensing;channel handoff;heuristic exhaustive search-based algorithm;suboptimal low complexity Karuh-Kuhn-Tucker condition-based algorithm;OPS;variable rate m-QAM modulation;cognitive radio assisted channel access strategies;distributed time slotted-cognitive medium access control;DTS-CMAC;centralized common control channel-based cognitive medium access control;CC-CMAC;Cognitive radio;Wireless sensor networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Computer architecture;Energy efficiency;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Media Access Protocol;Optimal packet size;cognitive radio sensor networks;energy-efficiency;quadrature amplitude modulation;convex optimization;medium access control},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2619358},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In a conventional EMS, they have difficulties in obtaining causes of emergencies and personal medical histories, which are important for a rapid and proper response. We analyzed the requirement of a smart EMS (SEMS) system and derived the key components in connected care environments leveraging information and communication technology.

LoRaWAN, as a Long-Range Wide Area Network specification recommended by the LoRa Alliance, is a low power and long distance communication protocol suitable for IoT environments. This protocol adopts a widely used data encryption method, i.e., Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), developed based on powerful algebra operations and multiple encryption cycles to ensure its communication security. LoRaWAN reduces communication power by setting different transmission latencies for different end-devices; however, AES does not take into account its end device’s encryption power. In this paper, a high secure but low-power consumption communication scheme for the LoRaWAN, named the Secure Low Power Communication (SeLPC) method, is proposed to further reduce end-devices’ data encryption power by reducing encryption cycles of AES. In the SeLPC, encryption key and D-Box update procedure is presented to enhance security level and simplify the AES encryption process so that the power consumption can be further lowered. Comparing with the traditional AES, the analysis results show that the SeLPC can minimize the encryption power up to 26.2%. The SeLPC can also resist three attacks, including known-key, replay, and eavesdropping attacks and is practically helpful for use in LoRaWAN IoT environments.},   keywords={Encryption;Servers;Logic gates;Power demand;Network servers;Internet of Things;LoRaWAN;low power;data encryption;AES;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2852563},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Context-Aware Data Processing to Enhance Quality of Measurements in Wireless Health Systems: An Application to MET Calculation of Exergaming Actions}, 
  year={2015},   volume={2},   number={1},   pages={84-93},   abstract={Wireless health systems enable remote and continuous monitoring of individuals, with applications in elderly care support, chronic disease management, and preventive care. The underlying sensing platform provides constructs that consider the quality of information driven from the system and ensure the reliability/validity of the outcomes to support the decision-making processes. In this paper, we present an approach to integrate contextual information within the data processing flow in order to improve the quality of measurements. We focus on a pilot application that uses wearable motion sensors to calculate metabolic equivalent of task (MET) of exergaming movements. Exergames need to show energy expenditure values, often using accelerometer approximations applied to general activities. We focus on two contextual factors, namely “activity type” and “sensor location,” and demonstrate how these factors can be used to enhance the measured values, since allocating larger weights to more informative sensors can improve the final measurements. Further, designing regression models for each activity provides better results than any generalized model.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={878-881},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) changes many sectors of our lives. In the healthcare domain, IoT presents as mobile medical applications over various sensors that update healthcare professionals on patients' health information. However, IoT-based healthcare systems also face major challenges in protecting patients' privacy via an effective access control system. This paper presents an ambient home solution framework for privacy-preserving monitoring of patients' health status. We focus on two major points: 1) how to use the data collected from ambient and biometric sensors, to perform the high-level task of activity recognition, and 2) how to secure the collected healthcare data via effective access control. We achieve multi-level access control by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for authorisation. Our access control system regulates access to healthcare data by classification over healthcare professionals and data. Our system provides guidelines to define data classes and healthcare professional groups and specifies security policies to control access to the data classes. The system is flexible and can incorporate more policy rules, professionals, and data classes.},   keywords={authorisation;data privacy;health care;home computing;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient monitoring;public key cryptography;ambient home solution framework;IoT;ABAC;attribute-based access control;PKI;public key infrastructure;high-level activity recognition task;security policies;IoT-based healthcare systems;mobile medical applications;healthcare domain;Internet of Things;personal healthcare monitoring;multilevel privacy-preserving Access Control;data classes;multilevel access control;collected healthcare data;biometric sensors;ambient sensors;privacy-preserving monitoring;Medical services;Access control;Sensors;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Data privacy;access control;ambient assisted living;Internet of Things;authentication;multi-level access control},   doi={10.1109/ICWS.2017.111},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

In business, industries, institutions and organizations, individuals contribute the data volume like technical reports, seminar reports, research papers, dissertations, thesis etc. For instance, 30 billion web pages are accessed or the World Wide Web. With terrific number of pages of that exist today; search engines assume a significant role in the current internet of thing (IOT). So with billions of web pages accessible on the web, a user query entered in the search engine may returns thousands of web pages, and thus it becomes extremely important to rank these results in such a way that the most “related” or “important” or “authorized” pages are displayed first. This job of prioritizing the results is performed by ranking algorithms, and various search engines use different schemes for ranking the results. Ranking of data can also do in heterogeneous data to retrieve information from the Dataspace. The aim of this paper is to describe Dataspace and present a survey on ranking algorithms, and their comparison, Comparison is done on the basis of some parameters such as main technique use, methodology, and input parameter, and relevancy, quality of results, importance and limitations, search engines and time complexity of algorithms.

There are few IoT systems in the present literature that are focused on monitoring and management of COPD patients, but they are not focused on the vast amount of data that IoT generates in a large scale deployment, and the integration of Smart City services. For these reasons, this paper presents an innovative system based on Cloud Computing and Big Data technologies to integrate Smart City services into a large scale scenario. To do so, this system proposes a Big Data architecture based on Apache Spark libraries to provide data integration, storage, descriptive and predictive analysis. Also, the system provides a web interface application where users can visualize the data analysis results.

The insulin pump system is an autonomous, wearable external device, commonly used by diabetic patients to take insulin efficiently, as compared to manual injection through a syringe. Security attacks may disrupt the working of insulin pump system by delivering the lethal dose to patients and endanger their lives. In this paper, we ensure the correct dosing process of insulin pump system based on the combination of deep learning model and gestures performed by the patient. Specifically, we used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict the thresh hold value of insulin based on last three months log of insulin pump system. If the amount of insulin to be injected by the insulin pump system is greater than our predicted thresh hold amount, then our system asks the patient to perform the gesture. After successful recognition of the patient's gesture, our solution compares the suspicious value of insulin with patient's gesture and identifies an attack.},   keywords={biomedical communication;biomedical equipment;biomedical telemetry;data privacy;diseases;gesture recognition;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient monitoring;patient treatment;recurrent neural nets;recurrent neural network;LSTM;long short-term memory;wearable external device;security attacks;medical devices;gesture recognition;deep learning;patient health monitoring;radio communication chips;insulin pump system;Insulin pumps;Insulin;Security;Recurrent neural networks;Machine learning;Sugar;Gesture recognition;Security;Deep Learning;Healthcare;Internet of Things;Network Attacks},   doi={10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00258},   ISSN={2324-9013},   month={Aug},}

Data are streamed from multiple sources and is traversed through intermediate nodes until it arrives at sink node which performs decision-making for critical infrastructures. Malicious or compromised nodes may forge data or inject false data. Therefore, assuring high data trustworthiness is crucial for precise decision-making. Data provenance play an important role in evaluating the trustworthiness of data. However, provenance management for resource-constrained devices introduces several challenging requirements, such as network overhead, energy consumption, and efficient storage. In this paper, we formulate the problem of binding IoT with a provenance-aware system to enable it to track the data flow across the networked entities and data transformations applied to data by nodes. We propose a lightweight scheme to transmit provenance for IoT sensor data. The proposed technique relies on the hash chain scheme to encode provenance as the packet traversed from each participating node while the provenance verification is done at the sink node.

Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services, such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering-based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient's real-time data at fog layer. Temporal mining concept is used to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health data of 67 patients in IoT-based smart home environment was systematically generated for 30 days.

The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities.

Further, these optical devices consume a large amount of power in order to receive a sufficient signal, resulting in the need for frequent battery recharging. To address these shortcomings we present a new wrist ECG wearable that is similar to the clinical approach for heart monitoring. Our device weighs less than 30 g, and is ultra low power, extending the battery lifetime to over a month to make the device more appropriate for in-home health care applications. The device uses two electrodes activated by the user to measure the voltage across the wrists. The electrodes are made from a flexible ink and can be painted on to the device casing, making it adaptable for different shapes and users. In this paper we show how the ECG sensor can be integrated into an existing IoT wearable and compare the device's accuracy against other common commercial devices.},   keywords={biomedical equipment;electrocardiography;health care;patient care;energy efficient heart rate sensing;health care systems;painted electrode ECG wearable devices;optical techniques;heart rate detection;battery recharging;wrist ECG wearable;heart monitoring;in-home health care applications;ECG sensor;IoT wearable;Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Biomedical monitoring;Wrist;Monitoring;Heart rate;Body sensor networks;Low power sensors;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Heart rate variability},   doi={10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016260},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.},   keywords={body sensor networks;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical disorders;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;Parkinson's disease management;wearable technologies;Internet-of-Things;IoT;diagnostics;self-assessment;objective device-assessment;patient experience;disease progression;physical deficits;intelligent algorithms;tablets;cell phones;medical database;lightweight wearable sensors;real-time motion metrics;laterally distributed platform;chronic neurological disorders;life expectancy;global healthcare system;Parkinson's disease;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of things;Wearable sensors;Wearable technologies;Internet of Things;Parkinson’s disease;knowledge discovery;patients;Internet of things (IoT);knowledge discovery;parkinson's disease (PD);patients;wearable technologies;Cell Phone;Humans;Internet;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Telemedicine},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2015.2461555},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Nov},}

This is due to the ever-increasing crime rates. Remote surveillance system have become popular, and enable people to monitor their properties in real time, via the internet. Video surveillance has experienced a number of technology shifts. The latest is the shift from analog CCTV surveillance to fully digital, network-based video surveillance systems, which are meant to be ON, 24-hours a day. It is also noted that commercial home security systems are still unaffordable to a vast majority of the middle and lower class families. However, the emergence of cheap microcontrollers, like the Arduino, has enabled the implementation of low-cost security systems, incorporating the majority of features present in commercial systems. Also, even though a security camera system takes up only a small portion of the total household energy consumption, a small step to green up the home security system will not only diminish energy spending but also reduce carbon footprint in the long run. In this paper, we present a highly scalable, autonomous, solar powered, wireless monitoring system that also provides live video broadcasting. It is based on a low cost microcontroller, a camera module, and an online internet of things (IoT) platform. A motion detection system was also implemented and the microcontroller sends email notification whenever motion is detected. The whole system is powered by a photovoltaic system. Tests show that the system is fully functional and behaves as expected.

The main objectives of this paper are: design and development of a light-weight ECG SQA method for automatically classifying the acquired ECG signal into acceptable or unacceptable class and real-time implementation of proposed IoT-enabled ECG monitoring framework using ECG sensors, Arduino, Android phone, Bluetooth, and cloud server. The proposed framework is tested and validated using the ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Physionet challenge databases and the real-time recorded ECG signals under different physical activities. Experimental results show that the proposed SQA method achieves promising results in identifying the unacceptable quality of ECG signals and outperforms existing methods based on the morphological and RR interval features and machine learning approaches.

IoT and advanced health sensors provide more convenience to patients and physicians. Where physicians can now wirelessly and automatically monitor patient's state. While these medical embedded devices provide a lot of new opportunities to improve the health care system, they also introduce a new set of security risks since they are connected to networks. More importantly, these devices are extremely hardware- and power-constrained, which in turn makes securing these devices more complex. Implementing complex malware detectors or anti-virus on these devices is either very costly or infeasible due to these limitations on power and resources. In this paper, we propose a new framework called SYNDROME for “externally” monitoring medical embedded devices. Our malware detector uses electromagnetic (EM) signals involuntary generated by the device as it executes a (medical) application in the absence of malware, and analyzes them to build a reference model. It then monitors the EM signals generated by the device during execution and reports an error if there is a statistically significant deviation from the reference model. To evaluate Syndrome, we use open-source software to implement a real-world medical device, called a Syringe Pump, on a variety of well-known embedded/IoT devices including Arduino Uno, FPGA Nios II soft-core, and two Linux IoT mini-computers: OlimexA13 and TS-7250. We also implement a control-flow hijack attack on SyringePump and use Syndrome to detect and stop the attack. Our experimental results show that using Syndrome, we can detect the attack for all the four devices with excellent accuracy (i.e. 0% false positive and 100% true positive) within few milliseconds after the attack starts.},   keywords={embedded systems;health care;Internet of Things;invasive software;medical computing;public domain software;SYNDROME;malware detector;Syndrome;real-world medical device;Linux IoT mini-computers;Spectral analysis;anomaly detection;medical IoT;internet-of-things;health-care solutions;wearable devices;connected medical devices;advanced health sensors;health care system;security risks;complex malware detectors;medical embedded devices;embedded/IoT devices;electromagnetic signals;open-source software;Syringe Pump;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Malware;Hardware;Medical diagnostic imaging;Clocks;Hardware Security;Malware Detection;Internet-of-Things;Embedded System},   doi={10.1109/HST.2018.8383884},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

While most of the existing efforts on Web of Things are focused on device mash up and data collection, in this paper a semantic web of things framework is proposed to leverage Semantic Web as the unified mechanism for monitoring, tasking, presentation, information flow and collaboration. Firstly, the requirements of human centric web of things application are described. Then the active linked data with data, task, context, computational organization, knowledge, presentation and interaction models is defined by extending the conventional linked data. Based on the active linked data models, we propose a semantic Web of Things framework, which leverages multiagent technologies to facilitate human-to-human and human-to-machine collaborations. Finally, a sample case on care coordination and ubiquitous health service roaming is given. This paper demonstrates how these technologies and architectures significantly enhance the capability of Web of Things for human centric applications.},   keywords={data handling;Internet of Things;multi-agent systems;semantic Web;active linked data;human centric semantic Web-of-things;Internet-of-things;network connectivity;device mash up;data collection;monitoring mechanism;tasking mechanism;presentation mechanism;information flow mechanism;collaboration mechanism;data model;task model;context model;computational organization model;knowledge model;presentation model;interaction model;multi-agent technology;human-to-human collaboration;human-to-machine collaboration;care coordination;ubiquitous health service roaming;Humans;Data models;Sensors;Semantic Web;Collaboration;Semantics;Computational modeling;Web of Things;Active Linked Data;Multi-Agent;Human Centric Application},   doi={10.1109/GreenCom.2012.12},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={441-446},   abstract={As IoT (Internet-of-things) technologies grow rapidly for emerging applications such as smart living and health care, reducing power consumption in battery-based IoT devices becomes an important issue. An IoT device is a kind of real-time systems, of which power-savings have been widely studied in terms of processor's dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. However, recent research has shown that memory subsystems are getting reached to a significant portion of power consumption in such systems. In this paper, we show that power consumption of real-time systems can be further reduced by combining voltage/frequency scaling with task allocation in hybrid memory. If a task set is schedulable in a low voltage mode of a processor, we can expect that the task set will still be schedulable even with slow memory. By considering this, we adopt non-volatile memory technologies that consume less power than DRAM but provide relatively slow access latency. Our aim is to allocate tasks in non-volatile memory if it does not violate the deadline constraint of real-time tasks, thereby reducing the power consumption of the system further. To do so, we incorporate the memory allocation problem into the problem model of processor's voltage scaling, and evaluate the effectiveness of the combined approach.},   keywords={Internet of Things;power aware computing;processor scheduling;random-access storage;real-time systems;storage management;memory allocation;processor voltage scaling;energy-efficient IoT task scheduling;Internet-of-Things;power consumption reduction;battery-based IoT devices;real-time systems;power-savings;processor dynamic voltage-frequency scaling;memory subsystems;task allocation;hybrid memory;nonvolatile memory technologies;real-time task deadline constraint;Random access memory;Nonvolatile memory;Phase change materials;Real-time systems;Power demand;Memory management;Magnetic tunneling;dynamic voltage scaling;hybrid memory;internet-of-things (IoT);non-volatile memory;real-time task scheduling},   doi={10.1109/ICIS.2017.7960033},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

In this letter, we are concerned with the design of lightweight and efficient algorithms for the lossy compression of these signals. In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals. While the presented techniques can be used with any signal showing a certain degree of periodicity, in this letter we apply them to ECG traces, showing quantitative results in terms of compression ratio, reconstruction error and computational complexity.

In the era of Bigdata, due to the enormous amount of information, domain experts are struggling with timeliness and completeness in developing insights for the future. In KISTI, we introduced a methodology in which human experts are collaborating with machine intelligence to overcome the information flood. Data-intensive analysis methodology is applied to implement the machine intelligence to predict emerging technologies. The intelligent service platform, named InSciTe, includes data gathering, text mining, identity resolution, reasoning, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics modules. InSciTe generates candidates of emerging technologies with the evidences why they are selected as candidates, and then domain experts make the final decision. In this talk, I will introduce our intelligent service platform based on the data-intensive analysis. Besides, I will show several case studies in the domains of ICT, internet security, and healthcare as joint works with NIPA, KISA, and KRIBB respectively. For the cases with KRIBB, human experts collaborated with machine intelligence interactively to derive the results.

Current models of care and pathways require transforming to become more citizen focused and support greater community resilience and sustainability. This will require different approaches to innovation to improve quality of life for people as they age, reduce onset of frailty as well as support those better with long term conditions around self-management and prevention strategies. Health and social care providers are looking at how they augment traditional clinical health related services with the use of IoT technologies and smart city services. This paper describes the on-going work of the Birmingham City4Age pilot, managed by the local authority, Birmingham City Council and funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission focused on the unobtrusive collection of data via wearable devices, outdoor sensors and other smart city systems that aims to help reduce the onset of frailty of older people. Locality and contextual data is being captured on individuals' behaviours with increased frequency that aims to help in detecting early changes in daily living - physical activity and social patterns and develop technology based interventions to help reduce the risk of frailty. The proposed systems architecture is being validated in two distinct neighbourhoods with contrasting demographics in Birmingham, UK adopting an iterative user design approach designed to support independence.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;public administration;IoT technologies;smart city services;Birmingham City4Age pilot;Birmingham City Council;smart city systems;contextual data;support independence;demographic shift;predominantly younger populations;current models;support greater community resilience;self-management;social care providers;traditional clinical health related services;time 20.0 year;Receivers;Aging;Europe;Smart cities;Sociology;Statistics;Frailty;MCI;Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon;Digital Log Book;Big Data;Wearables;Smart Systems;Healthy Ageing;Frailty;Internet of Things},   doi={10.23919/SOFTCOM.2017.8115553},   ISSN={1847-358X},   month={Sept},}

Recent research has enhanced physical health monitoring for the elderly in smart home environment. However, the social needs of the empty nesters have been less supported in smart home designs. A compelling story about the elderly can make the adult children emotionally attached to their elderly parents and establish a healthy social connection between them. In this work, we propose a data-driven story generation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT).

Some AAL smart homes uses infrared sensors to recognize some activities of daily living and to track people along the environment. Location tracking is vital in Ambient Assisted living and can be a useful information to improve AAL systems. A common problem in such systems is that each tracking model is based on a specific sensor's placing architecture. In order to assure that the system will work properly, the model has to be fitted by an expert. Modeling is usually costly and it relies on a specific architecture. In our previous work, the tracking model needed to be fitted manually. In order to introduce adaptability, this work proposes an approach to automatically fit the model avoiding the need of an expert to fit a different model for each kind of sensor's placing architecture.

However, in the IoT era, this development faces serious research challenges in terms of handling large amounts of data, designing efficient system architectures, and implementing appropriate mechanisms for privacy and security assurance. Especially the network security aspect of the IoT is of major importance due to huge amounts of data that the IoT is expected to generate and handle, and considering the limited resources of typical IoT devices. One of the serious security threats are the physical attacks on the IoT devices that operate in remote locations. These are known in the literature as the node capture attacks. Motivated by the aforementioned issues, this paper first introduces the background of IoT security and discusses the related challenges. Next, a secure group communication scheme that enables IoT using low energy wireless IP network is described. The proposed approach is based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing scheme, which has been enhanced to enable secure group-to-group communication of resource-constrained IoT devices. In particular, we consider the low energy wireless IP networking technology as one of the IoT enablers and the problem of mitigating the negative effects of node capture attacks on IoT devices.

In the context of Crisis Management Systems, this means that people owning mobile devices when involved in natural disasters or terroristic attacks may be considered information sources as the classical ones, e.g., sensors or surveillance cameras. Including the information from the citizens in the situational analysis processes comes with two main issues that need to be addressed: i) the source could deliver wrong data (voluntarily or by mistake) that damage the integrity and the correctness of the analysis, and ii) a significant amount of heterogeneous data need to be selected, filtered and aggregated, to provide to the operator a real-time snapshot of the situation depicted using only credible and relevant information. In this paper, we define and implement a relevance labeling strategy able to process information coming from heterogeneous sources aimed at crisis situations and to provide to the human operator all the details he needs. We include provisions for detecting and removing redundancies and misleading data that can slow down or compromise the process and the a-posteriori analysis.

Some of the applications of Internet of Things are smart parking, smart home, smart city, smart environment, industrial places, agriculture fields and health monitoring process. One such application is in healthcare to monitor the patient health status Internet of Things makes medical equipments more efficient by allowing real time monitoring of patient health, in which sensor acquire data of patient's and reduces the human error. In Internet of Things patient's parameters get transmitted through medical devices via a gateway, where it is stored and analyzed. The significant challenges in the implementation of Internet of Things for healthcare applications is monitoring all patient's from various places.

 title={Towards False Alarm Reduction Using Fuzzy If-Then Rules for Medical Cyber Physical Systems}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={6530-6539},   abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes. Its process control is often referred to as embedded systems. Generally, CPS and Internet of Things have the same basic architecture, whereas the former shows a higher combination and coordination between physical and computational elements, i.e., wireless sensor networks can be a vital part of CPS applications. With the rapid development, CPS has been applied to healthcare industry, where a wide range of medical sensors are used within a healthcare organization. However, these sensors may generate a large number of false alarms in practice, which could significantly reduce the system effectiveness. Targeting on this issue, in this work, we attempt to design a Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter (named MFAFilter) for healthcare environments by means of fuzzy logic, especially fuzzy if-then rules, which could handle the vague and imprecise among data. In the evaluation, we conducted two major experiments to explore the performance of our approach in a simulated and a real network environment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of fuzzy if-then rules could achieve a better accuracy as compared to the traditional supervised algorithms, and that our designed filter is effective in the practical environment.},   keywords={alarm systems;cyber-physical systems;embedded systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;health care;medical computing;wireless sensor networks;medical cyber physical systems;process control;embedded systems;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;CPS applications;medical sensors;healthcare organization;Medical Fuzzy Alarm Filter;healthcare environments;fuzzy logic;MFAFilter;fuzzy if-then rules;cyber-physical systems;false alarm reduction;Sensors;Medical services;Wireless sensor networks;Fuzzy logic;Industries;Computer science;Intrusion detection;False alarm reduction;fuzzy if-then rules;alarm filter;medical cyber-physical systems;wireless sensor networks;machine learning technique},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794685},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

In this paper, we consider a three-tier hierarchical m-Health system: 1) the sensor network tier capturing vital signals; 2) the mobile computing network tier processing and routing the sensed data to a fixed remote location; and 3) the back-end network tier processing and analyzing the sensed medical data along with patient's medical history. Based on this architecture, a physical layer security scheme for the second tier is developed and network performance of the introduced scheme is analyzed under different metrics using stochastic geometry. To be specific, secure transmission range and average end-to-end delay are analyzed for two different strategies: the mobile device transmits: 1) to the nearest neighbor and 2) to the furthest neighbor. Furthermore, we consider the cases of full knowledge on eavesdroppers' locations and when such information is unavailable. Results show that transmitting to the nearest neighbor achieves the highest secure transmission distance with the lowest mean delay when full information on eavesdroppers is available.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;stochastic processes;synchronisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;sensor network tier;mobile computing network tier processing;fixed remote location;back-end network tier processing;sensed medical data;physical layer security scheme;mobile Health cyber-physical systems;biomedical sensors;m-Health server;three-tier hierarchical m-Health system;end-to-end delay;mobile device;stochastic geometry;Mobile handsets;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Wireless communication;Physical layer;Network security;Eavesdropping;end-to-end delay;mobile health (m-Health);physical layer security;secure transmission;stochastic geometry},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2780263},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Feb},}

But the "quality" of the relations from Formal concept cannot be measured. That means we just know the existence of a relation, but we don't know how good or close of the relation. There must be a method to evaluate the "quality" of these relations. A relation is good or not might be decided by the person who cares about it. For different users, a same relation may be good or not good. So the evaluation of the "quality" of a relation would be given based on users' expectation. CTL is used in this paper to define the properties users caring about. An augmented formal concept is given in this paper to support the relation discovery on weighted SNS network. A user oriented relation quality measurement method is put forward based on CTL and AFC.

Among the benefits offered by this technology include remote monitoring of patient's health status and early detection of abnormalities in the collected signals. Once detected, several preventive measurements can be taken. However, this system needs to encounter some challenges in the wireless network such as delay, packet loss and throughput due to network congestion when transmitting and receiving a bulk of multiple data.

First, we provide a comprehensive investigation of cognitive computing, including its evolution from knowledge discovery, cognitive science, and big data. Then, the system architecture of cognitive computing is proposed, which consists of three critical technologies, i.e., networking (e.g., Internet of Things), analytics (e.g., reinforcement learning and deep learning), and cloud computing.

The ubiquitous smart devices can generate enormous amount of data which along with real-time analytics can drive unprecedented innovations, trigger new business models and at some point deeply touch the human life. As IoT's start driving mission critical applications, the need to pro-actively monitor and manage their performance-availability-scalability levels becomes paramount. Failure in doing so can lead to a direct impact on business and now to human life as IoT's get increasingly used in healthcare. Monitoring millions of devices generating enormous amount of data is a huge challenge but one which needs to be addressed soon.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1765-1770},   abstract={A better lifestyle starts with a healthy heart. Unfortunately, millions of people around the world are either directly affected by heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart muscle disease (Cardiomyopathy), or are indirectly having heart-related problems like heart attack and/or heart rate irregularity. Monitoring and analyzing these heart conditions in some cases could save a life if proper actions are taken accordingly. A widely used method to monitor these heart conditions is to use ECG or electrocardiography. However, devices used for ECG are costly, energy inefficient, bulky, and mostly limited to the ambulatory environment. With the advancement and higher affordability of Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to establish better health-care by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of ECG. In this paper, we present a low-cost health monitoring system that provides continuous remote monitoring of ECG together with automatic analysis and notification. The system consists of energy-efficient sensor nodes and a fog layer altogether taking advantage of IoT. The sensor nodes collect and wirelessly transmit ECG, respiration rate, and body temperature to a smart gateway which can be accessed by appropriate care-givers. In addition, the system can represent the collected data in useful ways, perform automatic decision making and provide many advanced services such as real-time notifications for immediate attention.},   keywords={diseases;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;internetworking;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;telemedicine;wireless sensor networks;low-cost fog-assisted health-care IoT system;Internet of Things;energy-efficient sensor nodes;heart diseases;coronary artery disease;heart muscle disease;cardiomyopathy;heart attack;heart rate irregularity;heart condition monitoring;ECG;electrocardiography;real-time monitoring;real-time analysis;low-cost health monitoring system;continuous remote monitoring;wireless transmission;respiration rate;body temperature;smart gateway;automatic decision making;real-time notifications;Monitoring;Logic gates;Electrocardiography;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Internet-of-Things;low-cost;wearable;fog computing;health monitoring;energy-efficient;low energy},   doi={10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986551},   ISSN={2376-6506},   month={June},}

  year={2018},   volume={5},   number={4},   pages={2548-2556},   abstract={Social Internet of Things is assumed to provide health services by incorporating social networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although, much development in therapy monitoring has been observed recently, few advancements have been achieved in the domain of in-home therapy. Existing industrial and medical solutions require complex and expensive hardware and software that are impractical for home use. Another challenge for in-home therapy is that therapists cannot confirm whether patients are conducting the therapy correctly and for the prescribed number of times. To address these challenges, we propose the multisensor therapy (m-Therapy) framework, in which multiple gesture-tracking sensors and environmental sensors are used to collect therapy and ambient data. The m-Therapy framework compresses the collected data and uploads to a big data server. The framework uses a model of the therapy to guide a patient performing therapy exercises outside medical institutions and even at home. Ambient IoT sensors can help maintain an appropriate ambient environment, which is generally maintained at the medical institutions. We have developed analytics that can provide live or statistical kinematic data, including rotational and angular range of motion of the joints of interest, and ambient environmental data, which can be shared with therapists and caregivers. We present our findings, which shows that the proposed m-Therapy monitoring system can be deployed in real-life scenarios.},   keywords={Big Data;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient treatment;social networking (online);medical institutions;ambient IoT sensors;ambient environmental data;m-Therapy monitoring system;multisensor framework;social networks;medical solutions;home use;multisensor therapy;ambient data;therapy exercises;in-home therapy management;social therapy of things perspective;social Internet of things;gesture-tracking sensors;m-therapy framework;Medical treatment;Sensors;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Servers;Gesture recognition sensors;range of motion;smart living;Social Internet of Things (SIoT)-based mobile therapy;therapy},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2776150},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

The hardware comprises three parts: a special pet sensor, an analog front-end circuit for detecting electrocardiogram (ECG) and breath signals, and a micro printed circuit board with signal communication. The software also consists of three parts: an algorithm for biosignal processing, an application (app) as graphical user interface (GUI), and a web server for healthcare. The algorithm is used to calculate the heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), high-to-low-frequency ratio determined by HRV analysis, breath rate, and basic emotion analysis. The app is developed for building a user-friendly GUI and communication platform between the hardware device and the cloud server. The web server not only provides detailed information to the veterinarian and the pet owner but also runs a convolutional neural network algorithm on big data to identify abnormal ECG signals.

Smart textiles were developed and provided to users who were asked to discuss their feelings whilst holding/interacting with a smart textile during a walk. In the study discussed, respondents spoke aloud while using prototype handheld smart textiles with wireless capability, soft switches and accelerometers. Voice recordings were collected and transformed into verbal transcripts which were comparatively analysed to assess their validity for understanding individuals' emotional states in Internet of Things-enabled mental health service design. This paper reports on the talk aloud protocol, and the creation of a data analytics model for semantically analysing the transcripts in order to identify the `anxious' from the `not so anxious' participants. The model comprises of two main parts: Latent Semantic Analysis, for semantically analysing the transcripts; and the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm to naturally place the data into the two groups. The analysis revealed significant differences between the vocabulary used by the `anxious' and `not so anxious' participants. Finally, we demonstrate how the voice recorded data can help understand the patterns detected in accelerometer data collected from the smart textiles, using the data of one participant. This approach further provides an understanding of how smart textile objects can be utilised to communicate participant reactions to environments and situations as part of a Person-Centred approach to smart textile and service design development with mental health service providers.},   keywords={accelerometers;data analysis;health care;intelligent materials;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;psychology;textiles;vocabulary;multimodal data analysis;wearable technologies;Internet of Things;mental health service environments;prototype handheld smart textiles;wireless capability;soft switches;verbal transcripts;individual emotional states;mental health service design;latent semantic analysis;fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm;vocabulary;voice recordings;accelerometer data;Person-Centred approach;service design development;Textiles;Matrix decomposition;Accelerometers;Data models;Singular value decomposition;Semantics},   doi={10.1109/IoTGC.2017.8008974},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

The 868 MHz LoRaWAN-enabled personalized monitor demonstrated sound potential with UTI test results being correctly diagnosed and transmitted to a remote secure cloud server in every case. Tests ranged over distances of 1.1-6.0 Km with radio path losses from 119-141 dB.

The UTI test strips were visually inspected for correct diagnosis based on color change and verified as 100% accurate. Results from testing across a number of regions indicate that such an Internet of Things medical solution is a robust and simple way to deliver next generation community-based smart diagnostics and disease management to best benefit patients and clinical staff alike.

In this study, a data set including patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or stroke) was constructed, based on flattening massive electronic medical records and aggregating such records into the patient level. After outlier removal, the total cost and length-of-stay (LOS) of patients were used to cluster the patients into high-cost utilizers and low-cost ones, depending on k-medoids clustering with subsampling validation. To further profile or compare the two patient clusters, median-cost and median-LOS difference between the patients with a specific type or number of disease in the high-cost cluster and those in the low-cost one were investigated. Ultimately, COPD corresponds to the highest cost/LOS difference among the five diseases, implying that it is a potentially important disease that drives high costs/LOS. Moreover, patients with all five diseases correspond to the highest cost/LOS difference compared to those with one to four diseases.

In order to satisfy these requirements, we propose standby slots that are deployed during each beacon interval. The standby slots are able to identify unscheduled data with low delivery latency. An adaptive beacon is then provided that quickly reschedules the time slots. Furthermore, the AB-MAC asymmetrically assigns energy consumption to a hub instead of the sensor nodes when possible in order to reduce node's energy waste.

 title={Handling service allocation in combined Fog-cloud scenarios}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={The recent technological advances related to computing, storage, cloud, networking and the unstoppable deployment of end-user devices, are all coining the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). IoT embraces a wide set of heterogeneous services in highly impacting societal sectors, such as Healthcare, Smart Transportation or Media delivery, all of them posing a diverse set of requirements, including real time response, low latency, or high capacity. In order to properly address such diverse set of requirements, the combined use of Cloud and Fog computing turns up as an emerging trend. Indeed, Fog provides low delay for services demanding real time response, constrained to support low capacity queries, whereas Cloud provides high capacity at the cost of a higher latency. It is with no doubt that a new strategy is required to ease the combined operation of cloud and fog infrastructures in IoT scenarios, also referred to as Combined Fog-Cloud (CFC), in terms of service execution performance metrics. To that end, in this paper, we introduce and formulate the QoS-aware service allocation problem for CFC architectures as an integer optimization problem, whose solution minimizes the latency experienced by the services while guaranteeing the fulfillment of the capacity requirements.},   keywords={cloud computing;integer programming;Internet of Things;minimisation;quality of service;latency minimization;integer optimization problem;QoS-aware service allocation problem;CFC architecture;heterogeneous services;IoT;Internet of Things;end-user device;combined fog-cloud scenario;handling service allocation;Resource management;Cloud computing;Delays;Internet of things;Mathematical model;Computer architecture;Topology;Internet of Things;Combined Fog-Cloud;IoT Service Allocation},   doi={10.1109/ICC.2016.7511465},   ISSN={1938-1883},   month={May},}

The iterative nature of the algorithm computing the distance of each data point from a respective centroid for a successful cluster formation until convergence presents a significant challenge to map it onto a low-power architecture. This has been addressed by the use of a 2-D Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer-based low-complexity engine for computing the n-dimensional Euclidean distance involved during clustering. The proposed clustering engine was synthesized using the TSMC 130-nm technology library, and a place and route was performed following which the core area and power were estimated as 0.36 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 9.21 mW at 100 MHz, respectively, making the design applicable for low-power real-time operations within a sensor node.},   keywords={convergence;digital arithmetic;pattern clustering;signal processing;unsupervised learning;low complexity k-means clustering architecture;mobile health monitoring application;supervised learning;unsupervised learning;cluster formation;convergence;low-power architecture;2-D coordinate rotation digital computer-based low-complexity engine;n-dimensional Euclidean distance;clustering engine;TSMC technology library;sensor node;size 130 nm;frequency 100 MHz;power 9.21 mW;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Signal processing algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Euclidean distance;Multiplexing;Transistors;Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC);hardware design;<italic xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">K</italic>-means;low complex architecture;signal processing},   doi={10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2633543},   ISSN={1063-8210},   month={April},}

Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized single board computer with ARM11 microprocessor. In this study, a system is designed to continuously monitor the Electrocardiogram (ECG) and other vital parameters. This data is stored in a database and can be displayed in a website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel. This idea is familiar however; this paper presents a substantive and inexpensive method using Raspberry pi. The primary task of this system is to update the data to the database and alert the doctors for any aberrancy. The former is accomplished by using MySQLdb module to link Raspberry pi to the database whereas the latter is achieved by the combination of Raspberry Pi and GSM module. This system has much future scope as the data gathered by monitoring is so valuable and can be used for scientific research by the medical community. By determining the patterns in the parameters observed, the nature of disease can be predicted. The paper mainly emphasizes on the system design and the algorithm used to accomplish the task.

With data volumes growing exponentially, along with the increasing variety and heterogeneity of data sources, acquiring the data you may need for analysis has become a costly and time-consuming process. Multiple data sets from various sources must be first processed and connected before they can be used by big data analytics tools. Publication and presentation of data analytics are also very important. However, traditional data curation systems are not designed for this purpose and there is no consideration on the chronological values. Another limitation is that they are usually designed for programmers, not for the ordinary users. In this paper, we propose Chronological Big data Curation system. In the proposed system, acquisition and care of data are processed on the basis of relations between specific topics and chronological order to ensure that data maintains its value over time. The system is implemented and experimental results show the goodness of the proposed system.},   keywords={Big Data;data acquisition;information retrieval;chrological Big Data curation;enhanced information retrieval system;high-volume complex data system handling;data processing;data acquisition;chronological order;Big data;Data mining;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Information retrieval;big data;curation;chronological order},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2642979},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Classic non-learning DOA estimation methods show unsatisfactory performance under low SNR or high reverberation conditions. Meanwhile, some research outcomes illustrate that learning methods with Neural Networks (NN) ask for careful array element quantity or layout regulation which is impractical for many applications. In order to obtain robust DOA estimation with small arrays, taking the learning ability of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), we propose to form the training pairs by using Acoustic Vector Sensor - Direction of Arrival (AVS-DOA) cues and its counterpart DOA which can be simulated under different SNR and reverberation conditions. Then DNN-based DOA model is trained accordingly and the performance of the model has been fully investigated with different activation functions, network structures and dropout rates. With the cross-validation process, the model performing best experimentally is selected as the optimal DOA model.

Blockchain is a distributed, peer to peer database forming a chain between multiple blocks of data. The internet of things works on a similar paradigm where multiple devices are connected to the internet forming a network of networks. Combined together they offer solutions for various problems, especially in the field of healthcare where quick reporting of data or results is of utmost importance. Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain. Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.},   keywords={health care;hospitals;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient care;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;healthcare;patient confidence;HealthSense;peer to peer database;blockchain-Internet of Things model;bio-sensor;patient medical status;smart contract;inter planetary file system;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Contracts;Internet of Things;Biological system modeling;Conferences;BlockchInternet of Things;InterPlanetary File System;MQTT;Representational State Transfer},   doi={10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389459},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Based on the revolutionary Internet of Things paradigm and emerging open standards for low-power and short-range wireless technologies, it intends to enable pervasive monitoring services through the diffusion of a large number of sensors around the aircraft, which continuously capture critical and non critical parameters from on-board equipments and the environment and deliver them to the remote monitoring devices through wireless communication links. In summary, TLSensing is composed by a number of constrained devices equipped with sensing and wireless communication capabilities, a central system coordinator that controls data acquisition processes through a dedicated monitoring software, and a web server application that collects data coming from the network and makes them available to the user and to external software entities belonging to the health management system. Starting from the description of the technological background that motivated the development of the presented platform, we will carefully describe both hardware and software components integrated in TLSensing, alongside their interaction and the most important features they cover. Moreover, to provide a further insight, we will also present how TLSensing works by showing some measurements collected with an experimental testbed deployed in our research laboratory.},   keywords={aerospace computing;aircraft instrumentation;computerised monitoring;condition monitoring;data acquisition;file servers;Internet;Internet of Things;measurement systems;radiocommunication;IoT-based measurement system;aerial vehicles;innovative monitoring system;TLSensing;advanced health management systems;Internet of Things;short-range wireless technology;low-power wireless technology;pervasive monitoring services;sensors;aircraft;on-board equipments;remote monitoring devices;wireless communication links;constrained devices;data acquisition processes;dedicated monitoring software;Web server application;external software entity;software components;central system coordinator;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensors;Wireless communication;Software;Wireless sensor networks;Aerospace electronics;Health management systems;IoT-based monitoring system;experimental testbed},   doi={10.1109/MetroAeroSpace.2015.7180662},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Due to the criticality and sensitivity of the data in the healthcare domain, ensuring the S&amp;amp;P of the Internet of medical things (IoMT) makes matters even more problematic. Lack of proper S&amp;amp;P in IoMT will not only leave patients' privacy at risk but may also put patients' lives at risk. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the S&amp;amp;P issues of IoMT.

A secure e-health authentication system is one of the important approaches in order to provide high security for the whole e-health monitoring system.

 title={Statistical QoS Control of Network Coded Multipath Routing in Large Cognitive Machine-to-Machine Networks}, 
  year={2016},   volume={3},   number={4},   pages={619-627},   abstract={Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication enables many applications such as smart grid, vehicular safety, and health care among many others. To achieve ubiquitous data transportation among objects and the surrounding environment, deploying spectrum sharing M2M communications with existing wireless networks is a must. A general large-scale cognitive M2M network (CM2MN), adopting cognitive radio technology, consists of multiradio systems, the primary system (PS), and secondary system(s) with tremendous cooperative cognitive machines, under heterogeneous wireless architecture. For these CM2MNs, due to dynamic spectrum access (DSA) nature, there exists possibly unidirectional opportunistic wireless fading links and thus traditional flow control mechanisms at link level do not fit anymore. Furthermore, effective end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control is still required to provide a reliable transportation for such multihop CM2M communications. Facing the above challenges, we propose a novel statistical QoS control mechanism through cooperative relaying, realizing virtual multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications at session level. In particular, a probabilistic network coded routing algorithm and the statistical QoS guarantee are first proposed to coordinate and cooperate tremendous machines. Next, based on the proposed guarantee and routing algorithm, the statistical QoS control mechanism is designed to enable MIMO communications for the session traffic. Specifically, the diversity mode is used to deal with PS's opportunistic nature and wireless fading, and the spatial multiplexing mode is employed to obtain the maximum end-to-end throughput. Simulation results confirm that under our control solution, the great improvements of end-to-end delay violation probability are obtained, thus practically facilitating network coded multipath routing in large CM2MNs.},   keywords={cognitive radio;cooperative communication;fading channels;MIMO communication;network coding;probability;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication network routing;statistical QoS control;network coded multipath routing;cognitive machine-to-machine networks;smart grid;vehicular safety;health care;ubiquitous data transportation;spectrum sharing;wireless networks;cognitive radio technology;multiradio systems;primary system;secondary system;cooperative cognitive machines;heterogeneous wireless architecture;dynamic spectrum access;wireless fading links;flow control mechanisms;quality-of-service;multiple-input and multiple-output communications;probabilistic network coded routing algorithm;MIMO communications;spatial multiplexing;Quality of service;MIMO;Routing;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Delays;Network coding;Cognitive radio;cooperative relay;effective capacity;machine-to-machine (M2M) communications;network coded multipath routing;statistical quality-of-service (QoS) control},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2015.2478435},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={216-220},   abstract={The increasing stress on the global healthcare system driven by the rise of chronic disease and an aging population is necessitating an emphasis on proactive health monitoring and self-management. Potential exists in the wave of emerging wearable devices and the internet of things (IoT) to support a movement towards the decentralization of healthcare. In particular, mobility impairments caused by injury or chronic disease are a major source of concern in the aging population. Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on assistive devices, such as canes or walkers to increase safety and stability. Given the prevalence of assistive devices among these users, instrumenting and connecting assistive technologies could be an effective means of unobtrusive activity monitoring. In this work we present an affordable hybrid sensorized cane, capable of measuring loading, mobility and stability information. The proposed system, which is nearly indistinguishable from a traditional cane, collects these data and then wirelessly transmits them to a mobile device for cloud storage and analysis. A multi-sensor fusion algorithm was used to segment valid gait cycles and identify various temporal gait events. Based on preliminary results, it is believed that the proposed system will be able to identify a variety of gait perturbations, potentially offering future applications in early diagnosis and the management of chronic conditions.},   keywords={assisted living;body sensor networks;cloud computing;gait analysis;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;sensor fusion;multisensor IoT;assistive device;discrete gait monitoring;deployable gait monitoring;global healthcare system;chronic disease;wearable devices;particular impairments;mobility impairments;walkers;assistive technologies;unobtrusive activity monitoring;mobile device;multisensor fusion algorithm;health monitoring;gait cycles;hybrid sensorized canes;cloud storage;Monitoring;Batteries;Biomedical monitoring;Instruments;Stability analysis;Aging;Sociology},   doi={10.1109/HIC.2017.8227623},   ISSN={},   month={Nov},}

In the modern world where the quality of living has been degraded significantly IoT can certainly play a constructive role in providing better services. In healthcare, there are several occasions such as patient health monitoring, remote observation and emergency proceedings outside the hospital where sensors can play essential roles. The coordinated sensor networks can provide even better services. IoT has the ability to provide all these coordinated services. Narrowband IoT (NBIoT) is an economical and simpler version of IoT which can handle these tasks effectively.

Injection Flaws are serious software vulnerability, and are listed on The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10. Injection flaws are introduced when the input data is supplied to the interpreter without proper security validation. Using Whitelist is an efficient input data validation strategy to avoid Injection Flaws attacks. In this paper, an improved object pool management method which provides properly validated input data as an object is proposed. Since pre-validated input, as a form of objects are managed through the object pool pattern, the object pool works as a white list and it helps prevent Injection Flaw attacks. Furthermore, it is shown that any performance degradation can be compensated by reduced object construction time, since objects in the object pool don't need construction.},   keywords={embedded systems;Internet of Things;security of data;object pool realization;whitelist strategies;injection flaws;smart heath care system;IOT systems;open Web application security project;OWASP;efficient input data validation strategy;improved object pool management method;Security;Software;Storage area networks;Medical services;Hardware;Computers;Educational institutions},   doi={10.1109/ICITCS.2014.7021734},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Systems that offer AAL technologies make extensive use of personal data in order to provide services that are context-aware and personalized. This makes privacy preservation a very important issue especially since the users are not always aware of the privacy risks they could face. A lot of progress has been made in the deep learning field, however, there has been lack of research on privacy preservation of sensitive personal data with the use of deep learning. In this paper we focus on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder, which is a principal component of deep learning, and propose a new encoding technique that allows the creation of different AAL data views, depending on the access level of the end user and the information they require access to. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated with experiments on a simulated AAL dataset.

This paper describes an IoT-based approach to the management intervention of type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is a major chronic disease with significant economic and social impact worldwide. Specifically, we focus on the structure, functionality, and development process of MyDay, which is an IoT-based, multi-faceted self-management problem solving tool for pediatric T1D patients. By leveraging IoT technologies, MyDay can connect with various devices to integrate traditionally paper-documented physiological data (e.g., blood glucose values) in real-time with psychosocial and contextual data, such as mood, stress, and social activities. By integrating relevant-but heterogeneous-data sources, MyDay can create personalized feedback for self-awareness of factors associated with diabetes self-management patterns and promote data sharing and problem solving. Iterative user-centered design cycles were used throughout the development of MyDay to document and/or troubleshoot feasibility and technical stability, optimize feedback for effective health communication through data visualization, identify barriers to app use, optimize assessment, and evaluate capability of the app as a problem solving tool. Each iterative design round identified technical and design issues that were addressed in subsequent rounds by incorporating user input and expertise.

RDC protocols achieve energy efficiency by keeping their radio off most of the time. Asynchronous RDC (ARDC) forms a subclass in which devices are not synchronized. ARDC behavior may lead to reliability and predictability problems for broadcast and unicast message transmissions in the MAC layer when the parameters of the protocol are not carefully selected, which we demonstrate by concrete examples. We investigate the dependability issues of generic ARDC protocols and provide analytical results for parameter settings that enhance dependability, while maintaining performance of the ARDC protocols in terms of energy efficiency and link delay. We also provide an analytical comparison of two widely accepted protocols, ContikiMAC and IEEE 802.15.4e Coordinated Sampled Listening.},   keywords={access protocols;broadcast communication;computer network performance evaluation;computer network reliability;energy conservation;Internet of Things;message passing;telecommunication power management;Zigbee;dependability analysis;asynchronous radio duty cycling protocols;asynchronous RDC;resource constrained Internet-of-Things devices;energy efficiency;predictability problems;reliability problems;unicast message transmissions;broadcast message transmissions;MAC layer;ARDC protocols;link delay;ContikiMAC protocols;IEEE 802.15.4e coordinated sampled listening protocols;Protocols;Receivers;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Broadcasting;Synchronization;IP networks;Unicast},   doi={10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568508},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

 title={An energy-efficient handover algorithm for wireless sensor networks}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-8},   abstract={This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an energy-efficient handover algorithm for the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that are the main building block in the creation of the Internet of Things (IoT). Our low-power handover design is based on a careful breakdown and analysis of the potential power consumption of different components of the handover process. With the scanning part of the process being identified as the main drain of energy, the algorithm is designed to place the majority of the scanning responsibility on the mains powered access points, rather than on the low-power mobile nodes. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and its functionality and low power consumption have been empirically evaluated. We show that the design can reduce the energy consumption by several orders of magnitude compared to existing handover algorithms for WSNs. These reductions substantially extend the lifetime of low-power IoT devices with fixed battery capacity and reduce their battery requirements of other IoT devices.},   keywords={Portable document format;IEEE Xplore},   doi={10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820636},   ISSN={2374-9628},   month={Dec},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Summary form only given. Nanotechnology is providing a new set of tools to design and manufacture miniaturized devices such as sensors or on/off chips networks. Such devices require wireless communications for information sharing and coordination. Unfortunately, reducing the size of a classical metallic antenna down to a few micrometres would impose the use of very high resonant frequencies, from the near infrared to the optical ranges (tens of hundreds of THz). This would drastically limit their communication range and require the implementation of transceivers able to operate at this extremely high frequency. Graphene offers a new approach to radically downscale antennas thanks to its ability to support the propagation of Surface-Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in the terahertz frequency band. Graphene micro-antennas provide a better integrability for future miniaturized wireless systems and represents an enabling technology for applications such as Wireless NanoSensor Networks, Internet of Things and On/Off-Chip Wireless Networks. In this talk we will describe the fundamental properties behind graphene miniaturized antennas as well as its applications.},   keywords={graphene;microwave antennas;polaritons;surface plasmons;terahertz wave devices;transceivers;wireless sensor networks;miniaturized wireless;graphene wireless communications;nanotechnology;miniaturized devices;classical metallic antenna;high resonant frequencies;infrared ranges;optical ranges;transceivers;radical downscale antennas;surface-plasmon polariton waves;SPP waves;terahertz frequency band;graphene microantennas;wireless systems;wireless nanosensor networks;internet-of-things;on/off-chip wireless networks;fundamental properties;graphene miniaturized antennas;C;Wireless communication;Graphene;Wireless sensor networks;Antennas;Resonant frequency;Nanotechnology;Sensors},   doi={10.1109/IMWS-BIO.2014.7032435},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

The potential of such a change is still to be fully exploited, and phenomena such as social networks and cloud computing are just two of the many innovative solutions that have been born from the Web 2.0. At the same time, a new class of users is establishing itself in the Internet landscape: in fact, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects are becoming the new, and possibly the biggest, Internet community. In this paper, we propose WebIoT, a novel web application framework, based on Google Web Toolkit, aimed at enhancing the interaction among things and between humans and things. Our framework leverages on the following principles: thing-centric design, modularity and web service communications. We will describe the main components of the framework, their interactions and how simple it is to develop any custom IoT application integrating any number and type of smart things. In particular, we will show how different things can be integrated in the framework, how they interact and how users can exploit these interactions to develop any complex functionality.

 title={PRE-Fog: IoT trace based probabilistic resource estimation at Fog}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={12-17},   abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time responses. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data has to be uploaded to the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, the cloud on the edge of the network, known as Fog or Micro Datacenter (MDC), plays an important role. Fog resides between the underlying Internet of Things (IoTs) and the mega datacenter cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. To achieve this, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we propose in this paper. Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can stop using resources at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management through Fog computing, we take into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. With the intent of showing practical implications of our method, we implemented it on Crawdad real trace and Amazon EC2 pricing. Based on various services, differentiated through Amazon's price plans and historical record of Cloud Service Customers (CSCs), the model determines the amount of resources to be allocated. More loyal CSCs get better services, while for the contrary case, the provider reserves resources cautiously.},   keywords={cloud computing;probability;ubiquitous computing;pre-fog;IoT trace based probabilistic resource estimation;ubiquitous computing services;pervasive computing services;micro datacenter;Internet of Things;mega datacenter cloud;resource estimation;fog computing;resource management;relinquish probability;cloud service customers;CSC;Cloud computing;Resource management;Sensors;Estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Computational modeling;Conferences;IoT;Cloud of Things;Fog computing;Edge computing;Micro Datacenter (MDC);resource management},   doi={10.1109/CCNC.2016.7444724},   ISSN={2331-9860},   month={Jan},}

The antenna topology and array geometry are carefully selected to maximally exploit the multiplexing capabilities of the ultra-short-range 3 × 3 MIMO channel over a wide bandwidth, yielding an increased channel capacity and/or reduced power consumption. In addition, special care was taken to guarantee a channel capacity that is less dependent on the relative orientation of the MU. Furthermore, the SIW implementation technology is combined with innovative antenna materials to guarantee a low-profile, low-cost, stable, and high-performance broadband array design that maintains its excellent performance after integration. A prototype of the antenna array was fabricated, integrated according to two different integration scenarios, and validated. Measurements prove that the antenna array allows integration into a worktop with only a minor influence on its return loss and mutual coupling, guaranteeing a bandwidth of at least 1.078 GHz and a minimum isolation between antenna elements of 30 dB within the entire (5.15-5.85) GHz band.},   keywords={broadband antennas;MIMO communication;mobile radio;power consumption;radio links;slot antenna arrays;substrate integrated waveguides;telecommunication power management;high data-rate ultra-short-range MIMO wireless communication link;threefold rotationally symmetric SIW antenna array;substrate integrated waveguide;three-element SIW cavity-backed slot antenna array;multiple-input multiple-output communication;mobile user;antenna topology;array geometry;ultra-short-range MIMO channel multiplexing capability;power consumption reduction;SIW implementation technology;innovative antenna material;high-performance broadband array design;antenna array fabrication;return loss;mutual coupling;frequency 5.15 GHz to 5.85 GHz;Antenna arrays;MIMO;Slot antennas;Arrays;Wireless communication;Topology;Bandwidth;Internet of Things;Integrated Waveguide;Cavity-backed Slot Antenna;5 GHz Wi-Fi;antenna array;cavity-backed slot antenna;Internet of Things (IoT);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW);ultra-short-range;unlicensed national information infrastructure (U-NII) radio bands},   doi={10.1109/TAP.2016.2536163},   ISSN={0018-926X},   month={May},}

In this paper, we examine the performance of the route maintenance processes that are provided in RPL protocol (the combination of Neighbor Unreachability Detection Mechanism (NUD), Objective Function Zero (OF0) and The Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function (MRHOF)). Both practical and simulation experiments are conducted. The results from the practical experiments shows that the performance in term of Packet Reception Ratio from the combination between NUD and MRHOF is better than the combination between NUD and OF0. Moreover, the simulation experiments are also conducted to explore the best approach to improve the route maintenance processes by modifying two parameters in NUD and MRHOF mechanisms. The results from the simulation experiments indicate that when the data rate is low, modifying the value of the parameter in MRHOF can significantly improve the performance of the route maintenance processes but the careful consideration is required.},   keywords={Internet of Things;IP networks;maintenance engineering;routing protocols;wireless channels;route maintenance processes;RPL protocol;smart building;smart cities;network types;unreliable wireless channel condition;IPv6 Routing Protocol;Lossy Networks;lossy environment problem;NUD;MRHOF;simulation experiments;Internet-of-Thing systems;low-power networks;neighbor unreachability detection mechanism;objective function zero;OF0;minimum rank-with-hysteresis objective function;packet reception ratio;Routing protocols;Maintenance engineering;Linear programming;Routing;Measurement;Wireless communication},   doi={10.1109/ICITEED.2017.8250505},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

A continuous object is usually blowout over a large area and therefore a large number of sensor nodes are required for tracking and detection. The nodes exchange control messages with each other and with sink node to report their detection status. For accurate tracking and detection nodes at the phenomenon boundary needs to be carefully selected. In this paper, we use four proximity graphs and different spatial interpolation methods for accurate boundary estimation and boundary nodes selection in a dense duty-cycled wireless sensor network. Accurate and reliable nodes are carefully chosen to be awakened when their sensual data is more applicable and consistent to be boundary node. To reduce overall network energy consumption and increase system lifetime, we propose sensor node scheduling scheme. Extensive simulation result shows that the proposed continuous objects detection and tracking technique is more energy efficient and the boundary area can be enhanced more accurately.},   keywords={graph theory;interpolation;object detection;object tracking;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;wireless sensor networks;mud flow;oil spill;forest fire;toxic gases detection;boundary nodes selection;network energy consumption;sensor node scheduling scheme;energy efficient;proximity graphs;duty-cycled wireless sensor network;objects detection;boundary estimation;spatial interpolation methods;Wireless sensor networks;Planarization;Clustering algorithms;Interpolation;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Object detection;Boundary detection, Continuous object, Spatial interpolation methods, Wireless sensor network},   doi={10.1109/SmartIoT.2018.00045},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

When problems are discovered effective measures need to be determined and completed. This involves human-lead tasks that like compliance management tasks in general need to be completed carefully and reliably. The adoption of "Internet-of-Things" (IoT) technologies will transform today's prevailing factory automation to a new level of automation with unprecedented possibilities. Our research targets to investigate these possibilities in order to develop next-generation compliance management systems. Unlike today's compliance management systems, these systems are expected to offer automation capabilities and smart assistance for compliance managers. The article introduces a conceptual framework for a corresponding system that makes use of IoT-enabled heterogeneous multi-monitoring data. The system uses data from a diverse set of classical monitoring devices and from business information systems. Through a rule-based approach the users can obtain compliance status information and advice for compliance enforcement actions. The framework is exemplified by describing typical monitoring data and decision rules.},   keywords={environmental factors;government policies;health and safety;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;production management;IoT enabled multimonitoring data;EHS compliance management systems;environment health and safety regulations;Internet-of-Things;automation capabilities;smart assistance;business information systems;rule-based approach;Monitoring;Manufacturing;Companies;Industries;Automation;Production;Pollution measurement;environmental compliance management;multi-monitoring;smart assistance systems;rule-based system},   doi={10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977419},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={141-151},   abstract={Many solutions to important societal problems relating to the environment, health care, transportation, etc. seek to utilize the promises of the Internet of Things (IoT), where sensing, computation, and actuation merge the physical world with the computational world. To date, many such solutions have focused on a single problem domain and require dedicated sensor and actuator infrastructure. This vertical integration makes the development of innovative, novel solutions costly and difficult to deploy. An architectural approach to addressing this challenge is to enable horizontal integration, where sensors and actuators from different applications can interconnect with any computational IoT application. In order to isolate complexities and to support heterogeneous systems and software, it is necessary to provide clear abstractions. We present such abstractions in the form of a layered protocol architecture that describes the necessary interfaces. Beyond technical challenges for horizontal integration, this paper also addresses network economic considerations since the various entities owning and operating sensors and actuators need suitable economic motivation to participate in such an approach. We believe that this work provides a conceptual foundation for future, scalable IoT solutions.},   keywords={cyber-physical systems;innovation management;Internet of Things;socio-economic effects;software architecture;layered protocol architecture;scalable innovation;scalable identification;network economic synergies;Internet of Things;societal problems;IoT;dedicated sensor;actuator infrastructure;Computer architecture;Protocols;Economics;Actuators;Context;Internet of things;Technological innovation;cyber-physical system;protocols;protocol stack;abstractions;incentives;economics},   doi={10.1109/IoTDI.2015.27},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={101-106},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a major change in sensor data collection. It is predicted that 50 billion devices will produce a large amount of data by 2020. This data needs to be stored efficiently so that it can be efficiently retrieved on demand for real-time application. Most of the Cloud-IoT solutions focus on centralized data collection and storage which is not appropriate for efficient data collection and utilization. For addressing such diverse set of requirements,resources are placed near to the data sources for processing and fast real-time decision making instead of sending all the data to the Cloud. The gateway is such a type of edge device that collects data from smart sensors, but it does not have any pre-processing or decision-making capabilities. Therefore, the gateway has to be made smarter with Fog capabilities and named as Fog Smart Gateway(FSG). We represent the distributed Cloud-IoT solution where data optimally distributed among mini-clouds/Fog nodes. The processing of IoT traffic is taken care of by Virtual Machines(VMs) facilitated by distributed mini-clouds/Fog nodes and located within the edge devices. We optimized the number of mini-clouds placement to reduce the total latency and power consumption induced by traffic aggregation and processing. However, there has been little research on fog node placement. Our results show that the optimal distribution of mini-clouds in the IoT network could yield a total energy saving and reduction in latency compared to processing IoT data in a conventional cloud system.},   keywords={cloud computing;decision making;distributed processing;Internet of Things;storage management;telecommunication traffic;virtual machines;IoT services;edge computing environment;centralized data collection;decision-making capabilities;distributed Cloud-IoT solution;IoT traffic;data collection;centralized data storage;Fog Smart Gateway;Cloud-IoT solutions;FSG;virtual machines;Fog nodes;distributed mini-clouds;Cloud computing;Logic gates;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Data collection;Data centers;Internet of Things;Fog computing;Fog node;IoT;Edge devices;Service latency;Energy consumption},   doi={10.1109/ICIT.2017.40},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

Fast encryption or physical layer security techniques are needed to secure the data. In fact, during normal conditions, monitoring data can be transmitted using best effort transmission. However, when real-time processing detects an emergency situation, the current monitoring data should be transmitted real-time to the appropriate medical personnel in emergency response teams.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={xl-xli},   abstract={With the advent of smarter systems and the drive towards `The Internet of Things', increasing the connectedness of people and things, most new products now leverage SoC-based platforms which allow companies to bring products to market faster, increase system-level efficiency and, most importantly, allow for continuous innovation and product differentiation. Design teams must choose carefully how to differentiate their products while still meeting ever increasing market requirements and stringent cost targets to maximize return on investment. True platform differentiation relies on a combination of both new software features as well as novel hardware features. Given the requirements to bring products to market faster that are truly differentiated at all levels, tools and environments are needed that enable both the software and hardware differentiation to be done with the completeness and ease of use found in a traditional embedded C/C++ application development environment but without compromising on architecture or performance. Introduction to SDSoC: The Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs are natural fit for design teams consisting of software and FPGA hardware engineers. Teams with limited or no hardware resources however have been challenged due to the RTL (VHDL or Verilog) development expertise needed to take full advantage of the benefit of the device. To resolve this challenge and enable more design teams to take advantage of Zynq devices, Xilinx has introduced SDSoC<sup>TM</sup>, a new C/C++ development environment. The third member of the Xilinx® SDx<sup>TM</sup>family of development environments, the SDSoC development environment enables the broader community of embedded software developers to leverage the power of hardware and software `all programmable' devices. The SDSoC Development Environment accelerates development of Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs in two ways. First software developers can get started sooner over a traditional hardware/ software development flow by leveraging Xilinx, 3rd party or end user platforms. Second, SDSoC eliminates the churn between hardware and software teams typically required to take advantage of programmable logic as software accelerators, truly accelerating overall system development.},   keywords={field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;Internet of Things;logic design;programmable logic devices;system-on-chip;Xilinx SDSoC designing;Internet of Things;SoC-based platforms;Zynq SoC;MPSoC;FPGA hardware engineers;RTL;VHDL;Verilog;C/C++ development;Xilinx® SDxTM family;software developers;programmable logic;software accelerators;Software;Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Training;Tutorials;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/VLSID.2017.97},   ISSN={2380-6923},   month={Jan},}

Risks may arise from factors such as printer manufacturers not having the requisite levels of security awareness, and not fully understanding the need for security measures to protect intellectual property, and other sensitive data that are stored, accessed, and transmitted from such devices. This paper examines the security features of two different models of MakerBot Industries' consumer-oriented 3D printers and proposes an attack technique that is able to, not only, exfiltrate sensitive data, but also allow for remote manipulation of these devices. The attack steps are discretely modeled using a threat model to enable formal representation of the attack. Specifically, we found that the printers stored the previously printed and currently printing objects on an unauthenticated web server. We also ascertain that the transport layer security implementation on these devices was flawed, which severely affected the security of these devices and allowed for remote exploitation. Countermeasures to the attack that are implementable by both the manufacturer and the user of the printer are presented.},   keywords={consumer electronics;file servers;industrial property;printers;production engineering computing;security of data;data exfiltration;remote exploitation attack;consumer 3D printers;industry sectors;printer manufacturers;security awareness;intellectual property protection;MakerBot industry consumer-oriented 3D printers;remote device manipulation;formal attack representation;unauthenticated Web server;transport layer security implementation;Printers;Security;Solid modeling;Internet of things;3D printing vulnerabilities;threat model;data exfiltration;remote attack},   doi={10.1109/TIFS.2016.2578285},   ISSN={1556-6013},   month={Oct},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={We study the decentralized caching scheme in a two-layer network, which includes a sever, multiple helpers, and multiple users. Basically, the proposed caching scheme consists of two phases, i.e, placement phase and delivery phase. In the placement phase, each helper/user randomly and independently selects contents from the server and stores them into its memory. In the delivery phase, the users request contents from the server, and the server satisfies each user through a helper. Different from the existing caching scheme, the proposed caching scheme takes into account the pre-stored contents at both helpers and users in the placement phase to design the delivery phase. Meanwhile, the proposed caching scheme exploits index coding in the delivery phase and leverages multicast opportunities, even when different users request distinct contents. Besides, we analytically characterize the performance limit of the proposed caching scheme, and show that the achievable rate region of the proposed caching scheme lies within constant margins to the information-theoretic optimum. In particular, the multiplicative and additive factors are carefully sharpened to be<formula><tex>$\frac{1}{48}$</tex></formula>and 4 respectively, both of which are better than the state of arts. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed caching scheme compared with the state of arts.},   keywords={Servers;Encoding;Electronic mail;Indexes;Additives;Art;Internet of Things;Achievable rate region;cross-layer caching;decentralized coded caching;hybrid scheme;two-layer networks},   doi={10.1109/TVT.2018.2873723},   ISSN={0018-9545},   month={},}

Experimental results show that the proposed method, which learns useful features automatically, outperforms conventional classifiers that require the hand-engineering of features.

But huge need arises to provide proper health-care services as the population is increasingly becoming urban-centric worldwide. The need-gap may be augmented with the help of modern technologies. Providing remote health-care services is a step forward. Successful diagnosis of health problems requires continuous monitoring of several health parameters. Health monitoring devices are power constrained and with limited communication capability. The devices are equipped with powerful microprocessors which are capable enough to take intelligent decisive actions by processing the received data. In order to prevent faster energy dissipation and constrained communication, selective data collection is an option. In this paper, a fuzzy assisted data gathering and alert scheme is proposed for healthcare services. Thus unnecessary waste of energy by transmission of unnecessary information is avoided.

It is identified as an easier technique and quick diagnoses of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a preventable acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Common diabetic test on patients are done on urinary test and blood ketone test to monitor for diabetes condition. However, those methods are considers as invasive, inconvenient and expensive. Recently, breath acetone has been considered as a new ketone biomarker because it is non-invasive, convenient, and accurate reflection of the body's ketone level. This research presents a method of monitoring ketone level by using breath measurement. Main objective of this research is to present an easy handheld health care on monitoring diabetic level with breath. Method consists of development of hardware connection with Internet of Things (IoT) system to facilitate the process of patients' diagnosis and personal monitoring. In this system, Arduino board is used to read the sensor with sense the breath. Breath value level is log to system using wireless communication. Data collection is interfaced to web page. Ketone level is measured as the amount of breath acetone is collected when patients exhale into a mouthpiece that consists of gas sensor. The reading from Arduino is shared to the database via ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Module and can be accessed by the patients or registered doctors. This research is significant where patients can independently monitor their diabetic health and the IoT system can be alerted directly to medial officers in the hospitals.},   keywords={biomedical measurement;blood;diseases;gas sensors;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;wireless LAN;diabetic patients;noninvasive breath test;diabetic ketoacidosis;type 1 diabetes mellitus;urinary test;blood ketone test;breath acetone;ketone biomarker;breath measurement;IoT-based personal health care monitoring device;diabetic test;handheld health care;hardware connection;Internet of things system;patients exhalation;patient diagnosis;personal monitoring;Arduino board;gas sensor;mouthpiece;ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module;Diabetes;Databases;Monitoring;Data collection;Gas detectors;Wireless fidelity;Temperature sensors;ketone;personal monitoring system;acetone;exhaled breath;Internet of Things;sensor},   doi={10.1109/ISCAIE.2017.8074971},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={826-834},   abstract={There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently. At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented.

The system alerts medical personnel in real time about under-weight cases or abnormal readings of vital parameters in order to take further medical diagnosis. Furthermore, the system saves the child's personalised measurements to a cloud-based data store in real time. Preliminary tests of network performance of the IoT application design resulted in an average latency of 1.7s and system availability of 99.96%, thus validating its usability.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;smart under-five health care system;medical information systems;medical diagnosis;cloud-based data store;IoT application;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Pediatrics;Internet of things;Sensors;Medical services;Monitoring;Internet of things;health care system;sensors},   doi={10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2016.7530674},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

However, the current Internet was built on a host-centric communication model, which was primarily designed for meeting the demand of pair-wise peer-to-peer communications and cannot well accommodate various advanced data-centric services boosted by the IoT in which users care about content and are oblivious to locations where the content is stored. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for the future Internet based on information-centric networking (ICN), which is called DataClouds, to better accommodate data-centric services. Different from existing ICN-based architectures, we take the sharing nature of data-centric services under the IoT into consideration and introduce logically and physically formed communities as the basic building blocks to construct the network so that data could be more efficiently shared and disseminated among interested users. We also elaborate on several fundamental design challenges for the Internet under this new architecture and show that DataClouds could offer more efficient and flexible solutions than traditional ICN-based architectures.},   keywords={cloud computing;information networks;Internet of Things;DataClouds;community-based data-centric services;Internet of Things;IoT;future Internet;information-centric networking;Cloud computing;Wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;Mobile radio mobility management;Computer architecture;Data-centric services;information-centric networking (ICN);Internet architecture;Internet of Things (IoT)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2353629},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Oct},}

IoT is evolving our knowledge and conception of the world. IoT aims to offer a common communication paradigm for all objects via the Internet and its protocols. For that reasons, it is being applied in all areas of life, such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, military, cities management, and industry. One of the major challenges of the IoT is to integrate IPv6, and its related protocols, into the constrained capabilities offered by Wireless Sensor Networks, building automation, and home appliances. One of the design considerations, for the success of the IoT, is to integrate what exists from IPv6, before creating novel protocols, in order to promote and ensure the interoperability, homogeneity, openness, security, flexibility, and heritage of all existing hardware, tools, and applications of IPv6. This work presents how to integrate the management protocols in IPv6 into the emerging IoT networks based on protocols such as 6LoWPAN. An overview of the different management protocols for IPv6 is presented. Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and the considerations for IoT management from works such as Lightweight Network Management Protocol (LNMP), and the Constrained networks and devices Management (COMAN) Group from the IETF are discussed.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-2},   abstract={In recent studies Machine Learning is regarded to be one of the disruptive technologies that will transform our future life, business and the global economy. In their 2013 study McKinsey identified 12 technology areas with the potential of a high impact on how people live and work and on industries and economies. In most of these areas Machine Learning is a key enabling technology. Machine Learning is learning from data rather than programming hard coded decision rules. Taking alone this short definition highlights the central role of Machine Learning nowadays. The worldwide process of digitization produces data in all areas as e.g. production processes, Internet of Things, health care and even our daily life. In this presentation, Machine Learning is defined a bit more precise. Going through the development of this rapidly emerging field, the different types of Machine Learning are explained and examples from different application areas are given. It will be shown, that computers are able (or will be able) to solve problems that were supposed to be dependent on human expertise in the past. Among many other benefits, this can be economically advantageous in many areas. This will lead to a broad dissemination of Machine Learning applications. The downside of this development is the fact that the future of our life and in particular of our work life will change dramatically. Some jobs - and in particular those requiring a low level of education and a high level of automation - are likely to disappear and on the other hand new job opportunities will open. Implications on university education will be discussed.

The Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) encompasses the new embedded sensing capabilities of devices together with the availability of always being connected, to improve patient care whilst reducing costs. This development highlights existing security threats as well as creating new vulnerabilities, making the once comprehensive endpoint data transfer frameworks less identifiable and challenging current techniques for information security. This paper reviews the new environment using HIoT, to identify the challenges for security and the impact of this on interoperability in the healthcare setting. Each device and sensor is a potential point of vulnerability for entire networks. The low power design, limited processing and storage capabilities, together with a lack of standard interfaces will also add to the complexity of effective security solutions.

  year={2014},   volume={26},   number={2},   pages={145-168},   abstract={Continuous and wireless transmission of vital signs for personalized healthcare is gaining a great deal of interest from Ambient Assisted Living solutions. Personalized healthcare capabilities are limited to the patient data available, which is usually dynamic and incomplete. For that reason, regular monitoring of patients with the aim of offering a suitable analysis of patient evolution is required. Continuous monitoring requires the integration of wireless communication technologies and embedded systems into wearable and portable monitoring systems. In addition, a user interface intuitive is also required, which is easy to use and understand by the patients and caregivers. This work proposes a solution such as Near Field Communication (NFC) for personalized healthcare based on the Internet of Things. NFC is a technology integrated in smart phones that provides capabilities for identification of devices/sensors, and presents ubiquitous communication capabilities between the sensor and the device. NFC also presents challenges in terms of the performance and efficiency of data transmission, due to the constrained resources and capabilities of ubiquitous devices and the latency introduced by the NFC technology. These challenges are intrinsic to NFC since it was originally considered only for simple identification and not for continuous data transmission. In this context, this paper presents a novel monitoring system for continuous data transmission from a set of clinical devices based on NFC which has been optimized in order to make communications feasible. This novel monitoring system is also composed by a set of participatory sensing applications to support caregivers and for patients to self-monitor and self-manage their health status wirelessly. A technical evaluation based on latencies associated with use of NFC for continuous monitoring and an evaluation of usability by a group of elderly users and their caregivers, which studies the interactions between the users and the system, are demonstrated.},   keywords={systems and tools for interaction design;usability testing;novel interaction paradigms;ubiquitous and mobile devices;ubiquitous and mobile computing systems and tools;assistive technologies},   doi={10.1093/iwc/iwt030},   ISSN={0953-5438},   month={March},}

In this paper we outline some of our experiences in implementing a data-driven security solution for detecting sensor-hijacking attack on a secure wearable internet-of-things (WIoT) base station called the Amulet. Given the limited capabilities (computation, memory, battery power) of the Amulet platform, implementing such a security solution is quite challenging and presents several trade-offs with respect to detection accuracy and resources requirements.

We can leverage this people-centric information, provided by the smart city infrastructure, to improve “smart health” applications: user data from connected wearable devices can be accompanied with ubiquitous environmental sensing and versatile actuation. The state-of-the-art in smart health applications is black-box, end-to-end implementations which are neither intended for use with heterogeneous data nor adaptable to a changing set of sensing and actuation. In this paper, we apply our modular approach for IoT applications - the context engine - to smart health problems, enabling the ability to grow with available data, use general-purpose machine learning, and reduce compute redundancy and complexity. For smart health, this improves response times for critical situations, more efficient identification of health-related conditions and subsequent actuation in a smart city environment.

Suggesting useful things in IoT environment is a very important task for many applications such as urban computing, smart cities, health care, etc., and it needs to be widely investigated. The goal of recommendation systems is to produce a set of significant suggestions for a user with given characteristics. In this paper, a multi-agent algorithm that, by exploiting of a decentralized and self organizing strategy, builds a distributed recommendation system in IoT environment, is proposed. Things are represented through bit vectors, the thing descriptors, obtained through a locality preserving hash function that maps similar things into similar bit vectors. Cyber agents manage the thing descriptors and exchange them on the basis of ad-hoc probability functions. The outcome is the emergence of an organized overlay-network of cyber agents that allows to obtain an efficient things recommender system.

Mesh protocols on top of BLE are currently emerging and the standard is currently being released. This paper first proposes a detailed measurement based comparison of two mesh approaches that fit within BLE operation: flooding and connection oriented networking. Using metrics such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and power consumption we conclude that the optimal mesh approach depends on the application. It is shown that for a comparable performance in terms of PDR and overhead, flooding can trade a lower end-to-end delay for a higher power consumption when compared to the connected mesh. We then propose an architecture, called Bluetooth Now, that is able to automatically switch the network between the two based on message priority.

Confliction of wireless signal in air becomes a serious problem which should be carefully managed. In this paper, we design a communication system model for medical equipments and IoT sensors. The system defines different communication priority for various devices depending on the necessity of functions. Some medical IoT sensors translate and receive the massive data every time and on the other hand some equipment just translate emergency signal for help calling. All these communication process should be treated separately to keep the efficiency of ISM band utility. The system has three patterns: (1) Devices with various communication standard can sense the existing of other devices.(2) Device can change its working state depending on the priority of itself and others.

In this article, we design and evaluate some IDS mechanisms for IoT Networks that are suited to small devices.

Agent-based computing can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems. Cloud computing can enhance the IoT objects with high performance computing capabilities and huge storage resources.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={24-24},   abstract={Summary form only given. Communication networks are changing: they are becoming more and more "software-based." The use of network function virtualization (NFV) to run network services in software enables software-defined networks (SDNs) to create a largely software-based network. To truly achieve the vision of a high-performance software-based network that is flexible, lower- cost, and agile, a fast and carefully designed network function virtualization platform along with a comprehensive SDN control plane is needed.Our high-performance NFV platform, OpenNetVM, enables high bandwidth network functions to operate at near line speed, while taking advantage of the flexibility and customization of low cost commodity servers. OpenNetVM exploits Intel's DPDK libraries to minimize the overhead of packet processing, and to provide high throughput, low latency networking in virtualized environments. OpenNetVM allows true zero-copy delivery of data to VMs, both for packet processing and high-speed inter-VM communication through shared huge pages within a trust boundary. We envision a dynamic and flexible network that can support a smarter data plane than just simple switches that forward packets. We build on our OpenNetVM NFV platform by developing our SDNFV network architecture that supports complex stateful routing of flows where processing by network functions (NFs) can dynamically modify the path taken by flows, without unduly burdening the centralized SDN controller. The tutorial will also briefly touch upon the problem of dynamic placement of network functions and routing of flows through a software based network, exploiting a mixture of centralized SDN control and NFV capabilities in the network. The problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, and heuristics can be used to solve the problem incrementally.As a case study, we examine the growing communication needs of 'Internet-of-Things' (IoT). With 'smart' sensing devices becoming ubiquitous, there is a need to support IoT communication at large scale, especially over cellular networks. The use of NFV platforms for the Evolved Packet Core, we see opportunities for supporting IoT communications at large scale in 5G cellular networks. We describe potential solutions in this direction.},   keywords={5G mobile communication;cellular radio;integer programming;intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;linear programming;parallel processing;software defined networking;high-performance NFV platforms;communication networks;software defined networks;high-performance software-based network;designed network function virtualization platform;SDN control plane;high bandwidth network functions;low cost commodity servers;Intel DPDK libraries;low latency networking;zero-copy delivery;high-speed inter-VM communication;trust boundary;dynamic network;flexible network;OpenNetVM NFV platform;SDNFV network architecture;centralized SDN controller;mixed integer linear programming problem;Internet-of-Things;IoT;smart sensing devices;5G cellular networks;Computer science;Internet of things;Communication networks;Software;Routing;Conferences},   doi={10.1109/ICDCS.2016.112},   ISSN={1063-6927},   month={June},}

Quite recently in IEEE Internet of Things Journal (DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2018.2828463), Liu et al. proposed a large-scale concurrent data anonymous batch verification scheme for mobile healthcare crowd sensing, claiming to provide batch authentication, non-repudiation, and anonymity. However, after a close look at the scheme, we point out that the scheme suffers two types of signature forgery attacks and hence fails to achieve the claimed security properties. In addition, a reasonable and rigorous probability analysis indicates that the security reduction from the security of the scheme to the hardness of the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem is invalid.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-5},   abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) devices has limited resource capacity. They have limited power supply, CPU capacity, memory, constrained bandwidth, throughput etc. However, these IoT devices can share the resources. Hence, they can be used in variety of applications like smart city, smart energy, and healthcare etc. Doctor-patient ratio in India is well below the global average. So, IoT can have profound effect on healthcare in India. Healthcare organizations must be prepared to play critical role in managing and analyzing huge volumes of data received from all health and fitness devices. In healthcare, several companies offer remote healthcare services through their platforms. However, most these platforms are proprietary. They can provide data and services to the specific devices and their proprietary servers. But these platforms cannot provide integration services, as they cannot communicate each other. They follow different standards or use different communication protocols. Management and interoperability of data is very important in healthcare. To identify issues in today's solutions and to improve the healthcare platforms this paper reviews different IoT platforms.},   keywords={biomedical communication;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;IoT healthcare platforms;resource capacity;power supply;CPU capacity;IoT devices;smart city;smart energy;doctor-patient ratio;healthcare organizations;fitness devices;remote healthcare services;Internet-of-Things devices;communication protocols;Medical services;Protocols;Monitoring;Intelligent sensors;Security;Temperature sensors;IoT;Interoperability;Healthcare Platform},   doi={10.1109/I2C2.2017.8321898},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

Community health stations do not have enough doctors to take care of their patients in traditional ways. In order to establish a bridge between doctors and patients, we propose eBPlatform, which is an information system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for homecare of the NCD patients. The eBox is a sensor which can be deployed in the patient's home for blood pressure measurement, blood sugar measurement and ECG signals collection. Some services are running on the remote server, which can receive the samples, filter and analyze the ECG signals. The uploaded data will be pushed to a web portal, with which doctors provide treatments online. The system requirements, design and implementation of hardware and software are discussed respectively. Finally, we investigate a case study with 50 NCD patients for half a year in Beijing.

The vital signs of our body are heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood glucose level. The respiratory rate monitor is one of the important vital signs which is useful for patient's who admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The respiratory rate is calculated by using LM35 temperature sensor and monitored the patient's respiration continuously based on voltage value of inhaled and exhaled air. NRF24l01 is used to transmit the sensor data from home to medical center. Then the data are published in a webserver using Ethernet to know the patient's status which is useful for doctor. And also the data is displayed in a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Once the threshold is reached, the alarm is generated and also a message generated in a webpage.

Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we provide in this paper. Moreover, since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types, having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management, we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java, while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources, according to each type of service customers.},   keywords={cloud computing;computer centres;Internet of Things;mobile computing;probability;resource allocation;dynamic resource provisioning;Fog microdatacenter;ubiquitous computing services;pervasive computing services;research community;real-time response;cloud computing;Fog computing;IoT;data filtration;data preprocessing;security measures;resource management framework;mobile nodes;resource utilization;service type;service price;Java;CloudSim toolkit;service provider;Resource management;Cloud computing;Estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Conferences;Logic gates;IoT;Cloud of Things;Fog computing;Edge Computing;Micro Data Center (MDC);resource management;Fog-Smart Gateway (FSG)},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2015.7134002},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving voice-based search scheme to enhance the efficiency and the privacy of in-home healthcare applications. We consider an application scenario where patients use the devices to record and upload their voice to servers and the caregivers search the interested voices of their patient's based on the voice content, mood, tone and background sound. Our scheme preserves the richness and privacy of voice data and enables accurate and efficient voice-based search, while in current systems that use speech recognition the richness and privacy of voice data are compromised. Specifically, our scheme achieves the privacy by employing a homomorphic encryption, only encrypted voice data is uploaded to the server who is unable to access the original voice data. In addition, our scheme enables the server to selectively and accurately respond to caregiver's queries on the voice data based on voice's feature similarity. We evaluate our scheme through real experiments and show that our scheme even with privacy preservation can successfully match similar voice data at an average accuracy of 80.8%.},   keywords={cryptography;data privacy;geriatrics;handicapped aids;health care;Internet of Things;mobile computing;query processing;speech recognition;privacy-preserving voice-based search;mHealth data;in-home IoT devices;healthcare systems;smart personal assistants;voice-enabled feature;elderly;disabled people;patients;in-home healthcare applications;voice recording;voice upload;voice content;mood;tone;background sound;voice data privacy;speech recognition;homomorphic encryption;encrypted voice data;caregiver queries;voice feature similarity;Servers;Databases;Encryption;Data privacy;Medical services;Speech recognition},   doi={10.1109/CHASE.2017.66},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

  year={2016},   volume={4},   number={},   pages={8418-8441},   abstract={Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients' vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users' sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users' side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way-which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users' health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.},   keywords={cloud computing;health care;middleware;distributed data collection protocol;IoHT devices;intensive privacy preserving processes;privacy regulation frameworks;cloud-based healthcare recommender service;concealment process;holistic privacy middleware;personal gateways;sensitive health information;cloud-based healthcare services;accountability act;health insurance portability;personal health information;privacy laws;healthcare data;healthcare provider;central nervous system;cloud infrastructure;living organism;healthcare Web services;hospital setting;personalized health insights;health data;healthcare delivery;Internet of Healthcare Things;healthcare things;OECD privacy principles;automated compliance;fog based middleware;Cloud computing;Medical services;Data privacy;Data models;Logic gates;Privacy;Internet of things;Patient monitoring;Internet of healthcare things;cloud based healthcare services;holistic privacy},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631546},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Implementation of open authentication protocol for IoT based application}, 
  year={2016},   volume={1},   number={},   pages={1-4},   abstract={Internet of Things is basically an interconnection of many smart devices which are deployed and connected to internet, serving people anytime and anywhere. There are many application domains that IoT technology can provide very useful services such as health care, transportation, infrastructure and home. Smart devices have limited efficiency in terms of computing storage and battery power. Due to the limited storage of embedded devices, it is difficult to implement strong authorization techniques. To overcome, this problem in the IoT, we have proposed a novel architecture for building a service using open authentication protocol where you need to use a user's private data that is stored on another system through the IoT device. Among the various authentication protocols available today, OAuth provides many leading organizations with a simple and secure way to authenticate users and permit them to access their protected data. OAuth provides client applications secure delegated access which is commonly used for Internet users to log in to third party websites using their Gmail, Facebook, Twitter accounts without exposing their password. OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the user, giving the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. We are proposing a smart fire alarm system that notifies the user about the occurrence of fire in his house. User gets an alert message through his twitter and Gmail account simultaneously. Fire alarm system is built by integrating IoT technology with temperature detecting sensors. In order to use Gmail and twitter our device need to authenticate on behalf of the user. For this we use OAuth protocol for delegated access to applications like Gmail and twitter. Conventional end-to-end encryption based techniques are not accurate to ensure better quality of security because of exceeding slow response time of the smart devices, and has extremely low processing clock speed. The proposed work can offer very high level of security without compromising on the processing lack. Results shows that, device offers a low latency as compared to existing system having with 35 to 45 milliseconds for implementing the OAuthenticaion scheme.},   keywords={alarm systems;data protection;fires;Internet of Things;message authentication;open systems;protocols;social networking (online);software architecture;OAuth protocol;open authentication protocol;Internet of Things;IoT;service architecture;data privacy;data access;data protection;smart fire alarm system;Twitter;Gmail account;Authorization;Internet of things;open authentication (OAUTH) Protocol},   doi={10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823267},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

The idea of electrical wheelchairs has been brought up and carried out as to help these disabled people to be more independent instead of always depending caregivers. However, electronics wheelchairs are not enabling for every patient such as people who have lost mobility due to brain injury or loss of limbs. Thus, the idea of Smart Wheelchair or Autonomous Wheelchair where it is intelligent enough to provide navigation with a series of navigation assistances has brought up to the table. The purpose of this project is to design a navigation system and an obstacle avoidance system for an autonomous wheelchair application. The obstacle detection system is done merely using the camera sensor with the knowledge of image processing. The techniques used are including Canny Edge Detection, Erosion and so on where algorithms are developed to identify and detect the obstacle. The navigation system is performed with the use of compass sensors where the compass calibration, compass reading and compass value comparison are done to ensure the autonomous wheelchair move in a correct direction towards the targeted destination.

  year={2011},   volume={16},   number={2},   pages={199-218},   abstract={The Web in the Internet today—especially when it comes to the Internet of Things and cloud computing—is the Web of resources. A photo album, an appointment calendar, a telephone bill, a health record are all resource examples, listed here in the increasing order of expected privacy protection. A few properties of these resources define the roles of three major actors: The resources belong to their owner, they are hosted by the service provider, and they increasingly need to be shared (say, to support mash-up) with consumers. Owners authorize consumers' access to their resources, which providers then grant to the consumers upon authenticating them and checking for proper authorization. In the past, this was achieved by maintaining an access control list for each resource at the service provider. Typically, such a list specifies all consumers along with their privileges. Emerging trends in social networking and cloud computing require elasticity, or, in other words, the ability to grant resource access to new consumers on the fly. Naturally, this comes with ever-increasing requirements for privacy, which dictate strong authentication of all actors involved as well as cryptographic protection of the involved communication sessions. We share the industry expectation that the technology that solves the above problem will be a major enabler for applications based on technologies that range from social networking, to video-on-demand, to health care, to smart metering, and—especially—to cloud computing. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technologies, including the emerging Open Authorization Protocol (OAuth) 2.0, and presents our own solution in this space, which removes an intermediary and gives the owner of a resource immediate control over defining access to that resource.},   keywords={},   doi={10.1002/bltj.20511},   ISSN={1538-7305},   month={Sept},}

However, more mission-critical application areas such as energy, security and health care do not only demand low-power connectivity, but also highly reliable and guaranteed performance. While fulfilling these requirements under controlled conditions such as urban and indoor environments is relatively trivial, tackling the same obstacles in a more challenging and dynamic setting is significantly more complicated. In environments where infrastructure is sparse, such as rural or remote areas, specialized infrastructure-less ad-hoc solutions are needed, which provide long-range multi-hop connectivity to remote sensors and actuators. In this paper we propose a new general-purpose IoT platform based on a combination of Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (LoWPAN) and multi-hop Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology. It supports reliable and guaranteed real-time data dissemination and analysis, as well as actuator control, in dynamic and challenging infrastructure-less environments.

Specifically, based on fast secure permutation and comparison technique, the encrypted user&amp;#x2019;s query is directly operated at the service provider without decryption, and the diagnosis result can only be decrypted by the user, meanwhile, the diagnosis model in service provider can also be protected.

Smart health is one of these scenarios. Indeed, there is a rising interest in developing new healthcare services for remote patient assistance and monitoring. Among all, the main promised benefits consist on improving the patients' quality of life, speeding up therapeutic interventions and reducing hospitalizations' costs. This is also known as Telemedicine. In this paper, we present a novel distributed software infrastructure for remote monitoring of patients with chronic metabolic disorders: i) it collects and and makes available information coming from IoT devices, ii) it performs analysis to help medical diagnosis and iii) it promotes a bidirectional communication among the end-users (i.e. medical personnel and patients).

Fog computing extends cloud computing by bringing the network and cloud resources closer to the network edge. Those resources are typically heterogeneous in nature requiring careful management. As the number of resources contributing to a cloud grows, so the problems associated with efficient and effective resource selection and allocation increase. In this paper, we introduce a fog resource selection algorithm (FResS) that enables automated fog selection and allocation for IoT systems. The proposed model collects and maintains a repository of fog performance data in the form of execution logs stored in standard formats. When a new task needs to be executed, prediction for its run-time is made by using these logs, which results in a realistic run-time estimate as well as best fog selection for task placement. Simulation results show a decrease in the overall end-to-end (e2e) latency of the system.},   keywords={cloud computing;grid computing;Internet of Things;resource allocation;historical executions;computational storage resources;fog computing;cloud computing;network edge;fog resource selection algorithm;IoT systems;remote clouds;resource allocation;Task analysis;Cloud computing;History;Edge computing;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Delays;cloud;fog;fog-to-cloud;fog-to-fog;e2e delay},   doi={10.1109/FMEC.2018.8364078},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

For the specific case of hospital environments, NEMO provides continued connectivity with the Internet for patients attached with 6LoWPAN mobile nodes (MNs) regardless of patients' locations. NEMO comprises a set of mobile network nodes (MNNs) that could move together as a single unit, and each of these mobile networks has a mobile router (MR) that can change its attachment point to the Internet as the network moves together. Even though NEMO has a low signaling cost, but there is a need to understand their challenges for a 6LoWPAN mobile network in smart buildings. If the MR loses its energy, the connectivity with the network will be lost. In this paper, to illustrate the challenges of NEMO in smart buildings like hospital environments, the traffic load at MR will be evaluated against the number of MNNs, number of handovers, and data arrival rate.

IoT systems continuously monitor the cyber physical and collect vast amount of data. Various analytics are developed to analyze IoT data and discover the business or societal values for their applications, e.g., home surveillance, smart readers, and location services. While we as a society greatly benefit from the utility of IoT data, an alarming concern of privacy breaching arises, i.e., data owners’ social and personal interests are revealed unknowingly. To address the conundrum of extracting utility from IoT data and protecting its privacy, the design of analytics is expected to jointly combine novel solutions in the security and machine learning fields. For example, encrypting generated data and enabling homographic computing can protect the data integrity; obfuscating data and disturbing the learning process with statistical noises are shown effective to guarantee the differential privacy. Moreover, due to the growing complexity and size of IoT systems, the implementation of analytical solutions needs to be scalable and adaptive to the streaming nature of IoT systems, i.e., data are continuously generated.},   keywords={Data privacy;Big Data;Internet of Things;Machine learning algorithms;Software algorithms;Machine learning},   doi={},   ISSN={2096-0654},   month={March},}

Traditional computer games and virtual reality (VR) environments focus on operability and the immersive experience. Controller devices are used to communicate from the real world with the virtual world. The usability of control methods affect the immersive experience of the users. Recently, many of these VR environments have adopted motion sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect sensors) Motion sensors can measure the user's movements and gestures to input control parameters for the virtual world and a self-avatar. Motion sensor-based games can help users to become more active and take steps to advance their health. Biological information, such as heart rate, body temperature, and muscle fatigue change depending on exercise volume. In this paper, we use a real-time biological information feedback to synchronize the user and the avatar representation. For instance, the color of the avatar changes according to the skin temperature of the user's face. We hypothesize that this representation method will motivate user activities, and improve the immersive experience. We implement a Scarecrow prototype using a streaming server for measurements of the user's behaviors and a front-end exercise game. We also perform an early user study to report the user experience and discuss the effects of the proposed method.

 title={Automatic Rate-Distortion Classification for the IoT: Towards Signal-Adaptive Network Protocols}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is being used to monitor a wide range of physical phenomena. In this paper, we are concerned with the extraction of features from the gathered IoT signals and, specifically, with the online estimation of their rate-distortion relationship. This information is in fact key to the configuration and adaptation of data compression and in-network processing protocols and, in turn, is deemed a prime functionality for IoT networks. The point is that lossy compression can be often applied at the sources to save transmission energy, while meeting application requirements in the reconstruction quality. This task is however signal- and time-dependent as different signals are usually characterized by different relations and the signal statistics may also change as a function of time. Here, we first formulate the rate-distortion estimation task, framing it as a classification problem. Hence, we consider the following clustering algorithms from the literature: multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, random forest and linear discriminant analysis, and use them to automatically assess rate-distortion curves in an online fashion and from a small number of signal samples. These algorithms are compared in terms of classification accuracy, training time and memory footprint. Numerical results reveal that, although the problem is inherently complex, the careful combination of feature extraction and classification tools makes it possible to reach high classification accuracies using only a few signal features (e.g., from one to four). The best algorithm (random forest) also entails a short training time and, if properly tuned, has a modest memory footprint.},   keywords={data compression;distortion;feature extraction;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification;pattern clustering;protocols;rate distortion theory;statistical analysis;support vector machines;signal samples;feature extraction;classification tools;signal features;random forest;short training time;automatic rate-distortion classification;physical phenomena;online estimation;rate-distortion relationship;data compression;in-network processing protocols;prime functionality;IoT networks;reconstruction quality;signal-adaptive network protocols;IoT signals;online fashion;rate-distortion curves;linear discriminant analysis;support vector machine;clustering algorithms;rate-distortion estimation task;signal statistics;Rate-distortion;Time series analysis;Feature extraction;Data mining;Distortion;Discrete cosine transforms;Training},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8255033},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

In contrast to process-driven systems where service mashups are statically defined, this approach makes use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of the presented system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support end users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system. This tool enables users to model the desired state of their smart environment graphically and thus hides the technicalities of the underlying semantics and the reasoning. Possible applications of the presented system include the configuration of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},   keywords={application program interfaces;fault tolerance;home computing;inference mechanisms;meta data;visual programming;smart environment;visual modeling;semantic metadata;reasoning;goal-driven configuration;process-driven systems;service mashups;embedded semantic API descriptions;dynamic environments;fault-tolerant;visual programming tool;smart homes;Semantics;Cognition;Mashups;Thermostats;Internet of things;Context;Visualization},   doi={10.1109/IOT.2014.7030116},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

By carrying out various types of cyber-attacks, hackers can disrupt the normal operation of a robot. It is easy to get control of communication between a robot and a human due to the open communication network after carrying out malicious attacks to jam the network. As a result, hackers can change commands which are sent by an operator to the robot, making usual activities impossible. For instance, in a case of ROS hacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojans, backdoor attacks, and so on, can change the behaviour of robots to something completely different than expected.Therefore, forensic analysts require a specific method to forensically investigate ROS. This is a new area in the computer forensics field. Therefore, it is proposed to create an analytical framework to facilitate the forensic investigation of the Robot Operating System and methodologies and standards for acquiring related digital evidence using forensic tools. This study addresses a formalized and structured methodology that would assist the forensic investigation approach.This research will help to enhance the gathering, identification and preservation of evidence related to forensics investigations of the Robot Operating System.

  year={2017},   volume={5},   number={},   pages={4621-4635},   abstract={Recently, big data analytics has received important attention in a variety of application domains including business, finance, space science, healthcare, telecommunication and Internet of Things (IoT). Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions.},   keywords={cloud computing;data analysis;Internet of Things;collaborative edge;cloud processing;wireless IoT networks;big data analytics;Internet of Things;IoT;data-aware intelligence;cloud computing;edge computing;Cloud computing;Wireless communication;Data analysis;Big Data;Wireless sensor networks;Edge computing;Distributed databases;Big data;data analytics;internet of things (IoT);cloud computing;edge computing;fog computing},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2682640},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

Because IoT devices are closely related to the human life, they generally handle critical data which must be protected from a malicious adversary. However, a majority of IoT devices are resource-constrained in terms of memory and computational ability, so that they cannot provide heavy security protocols and authentication. To protect connections over constrained networks, we introduce a back-end offload architecture which offloads the processing of a security protocol to a specified back-end offloader. The offloader assists constrained devices back-end by handling the packets of handshake procedure and encrypted application data. The load balancing of offloaders and the protection of offload messages are also provided in the design. The proposed architecture allows an extremely constrained device to establish a secure session by utilizing high-level authentications such as public key infrastructure or certificate, without the burden of deploying heavy security modules.

The increased connectivity and data sharing that give IoT systems their advantages also increase their vulnerability to attack. In this study, the authors explore the automated generation of attacks using genetic programming (GP), so that defences can be tested objectively in advance of deployment. In the authors' system, the GP-generated attackers targeted publish-subscribe communications within a wireless sensor networks that was protected by an artificial immune intrusion detection system (IDS) taken from the literature. The GP attackers successfully suppressed more legitimate messages than the hand-coded attack used originally to test the IDS, whilst reducing the likelihood of detection. Based on the results, it was possible to reconfigure the IDS to improve its performance. Whilst the experiments were focussed on establishing a proof-of-principle rather than a turnkey solution, they indicate that GP-generated attackers have the potential to improve the protection of systems with large attack surfaces, in a way that is complementary to traditional testing and certification.},   keywords={genetic algorithms;Internet of Things;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor network;genetic programming;Internet of Things;IoT technology;artificial immune intrusion detection system;artificial immune IDS},   doi={10.1049/iet-wss.2016.0090},   ISSN={2043-6386},   month={},}

IoT consists of communications and sensors to accomplish purpose. In the diverse kinds of networks, wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. There are many researches about WBAN and sensor network, which are mainly focused on energy efficiency. However, in this paper, we discuss more practical issues for implementation of WBAN to healthcare service. Therefore, we propose a multi-hop WBAN construction scheme that is consists of 4 operations, the clustered topology setup, mobility support, and transmission efficiency enhancement. As an auxiliary benefit, the proposed scheme achieves an energy efficient feature by reducing the number of total control messages. Extensive simulation shows that the proposed scheme remarkably improves the performance of WBAN.},   keywords={body area networks;health care;Internet of Things;patient care;wireless sensor networks;multihop WBAN construction;healthcare IoT systems;Internet-of-Thing applications;aging population;wireless body area network;communication tool;medical IoT devices;sensor network;clustered topology setup;mobility support;transmission efficiency enhancement;medical care;Medical services;Routing;Sensors;Topology;Network topology;Energy efficiency;Biomedical monitoring;Healthcare;Internet of Things;multi-hop;sensor network;WBAN},   doi={10.1109/PlatCon.2015.20},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={43956-43966},   abstract={In this paper, we propose a smart campus care and guiding framework with deep learning-based face recognition, called DeepGuiding, for students through Internet of Things technologies. The DeepGuiding framework can construct the dedicated video trajectory of a campus student, where the recorded video for each student can be automatically classified to achieve efficient footprint review as necessary. In addition, DeepGuiding can provide time-efficient indoor and outdoor guiding in a campus to quickly reach places, meet friends, and find students. To the best of our knowledge, DeepGuiding is the first campus care and guiding system which provides the following features: 1) it achieves the seamless outdoor and indoor navigation between buildings in a campus; 2) it keeps additional construction cost low by utilizing existing surveillance cameras in a campus; and 3) it reduces the total searching time for finding a specific event/target in a campus by alleviating time-consuming labor overhead to review a huge amount of video data. An Android-based prototype using iBeacon indoor localization and global positioning system outdoor positioning with surveillance cameras is implemented to verify the feasibility and superiority of our DeepGuiding framework. The Experimental results show that DeepGuiding outperforms existing face recognition methods and can achieve high recognition accuracy for students not close to surveillance cameras.},   keywords={Face recognition;Face;Surveillance;Cameras;Neurons;Global Positioning System;Servers;Face detection;face recognition;indoor positioning;Internet of Things;mobile device},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2856251},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This kind of system allows medical professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, etc.) to verify continuously the health conditions of their patients. As the healthcare systems manage highly sensitive physiological information of patients such as blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse, they are extremely vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patients' information. In this aspect, there have been many proposals and works providing security mechanism. Among those works, one of the latest work about a secure authentication system for healthcare system is the one proposed by Gope and Hwang called BSN-Care. In Gope-Hwang scheme, the authors proposed a lightweight anonymous authentication protocol and claimed that their scheme was secure. Unfortunately, this paper finds that Gope-Hwang scheme still has security pitfalls and limitations. This paper describes and cryptanalyzes the Gope-Hwang scheme to illustrate their vulnerabilities and security limitations.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={124-130},   abstract={With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the U.S. accounting for an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths annually, reducing and preventing these infections is a top goal for healthcare facilities throughout the country [1]. Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated &amp; intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting.

Managing the multinetworks for mobile IoT access is a key challenge. Software-defined networking (SDN) is emerging as a promising paradigm for quick configuration of network devices, but its application in multinetworks with frequent IoT access is not well studied. In this paper we present UbiFlow, the first software-defined IoT system for ubiquitous flow control and mobility management in multinetworks. UbiFlow adopts distributed controllers to divide urban-scale SDN into different geographic partitions. A distributed hashing based overlay structure is proposed to maintain network scalability and consistency. Based on this UbiFlow overlay structure, relevant issues pertaining to mobility management such as scalable control, fault tolerance, and load balancing have been carefully examined and studied. The UbiFlow controller differentiates flow scheduling based on the per-device requirement and whole-partition capability. Therefore, it can present a network status view and optimized selection of access points in multinetworks to satisfy IoT flow requests, while guaranteeing network performance in each partition. Simulation and realistic testbed experiments confirm that UbiFlow can successfully achieve scalable mobility management and robust flow scheduling in IoT multinetworks.},   keywords={Internet of Things;mobility management (mobile radio);overlay networks;software defined networking;ubiquitous computing;mobility management;UbiFlow;urban scale software defined IoT;Internet of Things;IoT devices;urban-scale deployments;IoT multinetworks;wireless communication;software defined networking;SDN;network devices;ubiquitous flow control;distributed controllers;geographic partitions;urban-scale SDN;distributed hashing;overlay structure;UbiFlow overlay structure;scalable control;fault tolerance;load balancing;UbiFlow controller;per device requirement;Mobile radio mobility management;Switches;Delays;Handover},   doi={10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218384},   ISSN={0743-166X},   month={April},}

Extending the finite battery life of massive number of IoT devices is a crucial challenge. The ultra-low-power backscatter communications (BackCom) with the inherent feature of RF energy harvesting is a promising technology for tackling this challenge. Moreover, many future IoT applications will require the deployment of dense IoT devices, which induces strong interference for wireless information transfer (IT). To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose the design of a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum (TH-SS) to simultaneously suppress interference and enable both two-way wireless IT and one-way wireless energy transfer (ET) in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. The performance analysis of the BackCom network is presented, including the bit-error rates for forward and backward IT and the expected energy-transfer rate for forward ET, which account for non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, and energy harvesting at tags, respectively. Our analysis demonstrates a tradeoff between energy harvesting and interference performance. Thus, system parameters need to be chosen carefully to satisfy given BackCom system performance requirement.},   keywords={backscatter;energy harvesting;error statistics;interference suppression;Internet of Things;multi-access systems;spread spectrum communication;telecommunication power management;time-hopping multiple-access;backscatter interference networks;Internet-of-Things;finite battery life;ultra-low-power backscatter communications;RF energy harvesting;future IoT applications;dense IoT devices;wireless information transfer;novel multiple-access scheme;time-hopping spread-spectrum;one-way wireless energy transfer;backscatter reader-tag links;BackCom network;bit-error rates;expected energy-transfer rate;coherent detection;interference performance;BackCom system performance requirement;low-complexity devices;two-way wireless IT;Interference;Backscatter;System-on-chip;Energy harvesting;Binary phase shift keying;Radio frequency},   doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254587},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2016},   volume={3},   number={6},   pages={1319-1333},   abstract={Routing plays an important role in the overall architecture of the Internet of Things. IETF has standardized the RPL routing protocol to provide the interoperability for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). LLNs cover a wide scope of applications, such as building automation, industrial control, healthcare, and so on. LLNs applications require reliable and energy-efficient routing support. Point-to-point (P2P) communication is a fundamental requirement of many LLNs applications. However, traditional routing protocols usually propagate throughout the whole network to discover a reliable P2P route, which requires large amount energy consumption. Again, it is challenging to achieve both reliability and energy-efficiency simultaneously, especially for LLNs. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient region-based routing protocol (ER-RPL), which achieves energy-efficient data delivery without compromising reliability. In contrast of traditional routing protocols where all nodes are required for route discovery, the proposed scheme only requires a subset of nodes to do the job, which is the key of energy saving. Our theoretical analysis and extensive simulation studies demonstrate that ER-RPL has a great performance superiority over two conventional benchmark protocols, i.e., RPL and P2P-RPL.},   keywords={computer network reliability;energy conservation;energy consumption;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communication;open systems;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;energy-efficient region-based RPL routing protocol;low-power and lossy network;Internet of Things;IETF;interoperability;LLN;point-to-point communication;P2P communication;energy consumption;energy-efficient data delivery;route discovery;energy saving;ER-RPL;machine-to-machine communication;Routing protocols;Reliability;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Internet of things;Energy-efficiency;low-power and lossy networks (LLNs);point-to-point (P2P) communication;region-based;reliability;routing protocol (RPL)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2016.2593438},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Dec},}

Indeed, we discovered that some popular smart home plugs have severe security vulnerabilities which could be fixed but unfortunately are left open.

Thus, designing efficient transceivers is crucial to reduce transmission delay and energy through leveraging data reduction techniques. In this context, we propose an efficient data-specific transceiver design that leverages the inherent characteristics of the generated data at the physical layer to reduce transmitted data size without significant overheads.

In this paper, we present a 6LowPAN based U-healthcare platform that contributes to the realization of the above expectation. The proposed system comprises two sensor nodes sending temperature data and ECG signals to a remote processing unit. These sensors are being assigned an IPv6 address to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) functionality. A 6LowPAN-enabled edge router, connected to a PC, is serving as a base station through a serial interface, to collect data from the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a program interfacing through a Serial-Line-Internet-Protocol (SLIP) and running on the PC provides a network interface that receives IPv6 packets from the edge router. The above system is enhanced by having the application save readings from the sensors into a file that can be downloaded by a remote server using a free Cloud service such as UbuntuOne. This enhancement makes the system robust against data loss especially for outdoor healthcare services, where the 3G/4G connectivity may get lost because of signal quality fluctuations. The system provided a proof of concept of successful remote U-healthcare monitoring illustrating the IoT functionality and involving 3G/4G connectivity while being enhanced by a cloud-based backup.},   keywords={3G mobile communication;4G mobile communication;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;personal area networks;telemedicine;ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks;3G-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;WiFi-enabled 6LoWPAN-based U-healthcare system;ubiquitous real-time monitoring;data logging;sensor nodes;temperature data;ECG signals;Internet-of-Things functionality;serial-line-Internet-protocol;UbuntuOne;remote U-healthcare monitoring;3G connectivity;4G connectivity;Electrocardiography;Temperature sensors;Medical services;Servers;Clouds;Real-time systems;Internet},   doi={10.1109/MECBME.2014.6783258},   ISSN={1558-2531},   month={Feb},}

In particular, the technique of body-area networking (BAN) and personal-area networking (PAN) are very useful in various image-based medical monitoring systems that cover a wide range of healthcare services, such as early detecting of emergency conditions and remote online instructing of surgeries. However, medical images are highly privacy sensitive and redundant. Thus proper protection on privacy and secure data aggregation/compression are also highly expected in medical image processing. Based on compressive sensing (CS) theory, we conceive a so-called &amp;#x201C;one-stone-three-bird" solution for medical image acquisition and transmission in this paper: The size of the original medical images can be reduced to 20%, the resulted images have very well confidentiality and supporting additively homomorphic aggregation.},   keywords={Image coding;Biomedical imaging;Encryption;Compressed sensing;Image reconstruction;Internet of Things;medical images processing;compressive sensing;privacy-preserving;homomorphic aggregation.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2844727},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1198-1203},   abstract={Today, numerous technological advances in electronic and information technologies are rapidly transforming our modern life. Industries are being completely transformed and health systems are not oblivious to these changes. All these new technologies are opening up a wide range of new opportunities and challenges for researchers, physicians and patients. The emergent paradigm of Internet of Things is one of the promising technologies introduced into the world of health care. In fact, IoT has been widely applied to interconnect available medical devices and sensors which allow patients to take control of their health condition in real time, also physicians to accurately remotely monitor the health of their patients. The ultimate goal of achieving high quality of healthcare practices depends on the ability to effectively integrate data incoming from heterogeneous sources, share the collected data while keeping their security and privacy, use powerful data analytics tools to extract useful information from these data, and the ability to have an expressive and personalized visualization. In this paper, we propose the SM-IoT platform, an IoT-based platform for intelligent and personalized healthcare, dedicated to patients, as well as caregivers. The aim of this platform is to improve the remote patient monitoring and promote healthcare services. SM-IoT platform is able to collect data from heterogeneous information sources, integrate them by using a flexible semantic web, store them in the cloud for further analysis, visualized these data with user-friendly interfaces and facilitate their sharing by taking into account their privacy aspect.},   keywords={data analysis;data privacy;data visualisation;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;medical information systems;patient monitoring;semantic Web;telemedicine;user interfaces;healthcare practices;heterogeneous sources;expressive visualization;personalized visualization;SM-IoT platform;intelligent healthcare;remote patient monitoring;healthcare services;heterogeneous information sources;smart IoT platform;personalized healthcare monitoring;semantic technologies;electronic information technologies;health systems;sensors;health condition;ultimate goal;data analytics tools;medical devices;collected data sharing;flexible semantic Web;user-friendly interfaces;privacy aspect;data visualization;Medical services;Semantics;Medical diagnostic imaging;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Sensors;Interoperability;Internet of Things;e Healthcare;Medical IoT;remote health monitoring;Web semantic},   doi={10.1109/ICTAI.2017.00182},   ISSN={2375-0197},   month={Nov},}

Study after study has shown that while people generally care about their privacy, they feel they have little awareness of-let alone control over-the collection and use of their data. This article summarizes ongoing research to develop and field privacy assistants designed to empower people to regain control over their privacy in the Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, we focus on the infrastructure we have developed and deployed to support privacy assistants for the IoT. This infrastructure enables the assistants to discover IoT resources (sensors, apps, services, devices, and so on) in the vicinity of their users, and selectively inform users about the data practices associated with these resources. It also supports the discovery of user-configurable settings for IoT resources (opt in, opt out, data erasure, and so on) if there are any, enabling privacy assistants to help users configure their IoT experience in accordance with their privacy expectations. We also discuss how, using machine learning to build and refine models of users privacy expectations and preferences, we plan to developed personalized privacy assistants capable of selectively informing their users about the data practices they actually care about and of helping them configure associated privacy settings.},   keywords={Data privacy;Privacy;Data collection;Sensors;Optimized production technology;Internet of Things;Machine learning;Internet of Things;IoT;privacy;machine learning;personalized privacy assistant;malicious computing;pervasive computing;resource registries;policy enforcement points},   doi={10.1109/MPRV.2018.03367733},   ISSN={1536-1268},   month={Jul},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={639-644},   abstract={The resource constraint is one of the top issues in the Internet of Things network. All activity in the network node should be carefully designed and managed to support the resource efficiency of the network. Hence, an energy efficient transceiver like ZigBee is popularly used as the infrastructure for the Internet of Things edge network. This paper presents our method for efficient ZigBee router node deployment which minimizes the number of communication hop in ZigBee based network in an area of implementation. The method aims to construct a ZigBee network tree topology with the minimum number of ZigBee routers while providing communication service to all points of interest. We use a virtual grid to transform the problem into a graph problem. The Physarum optimization algorithm is used to determine the minimum number and the position of the routers, according to the gateway and point of interest locations. The validation to the method is carried out using Matlab simulation. The simulation result shows that the algorithm can successfully meet the requirement with the accuracy level of as low as 93.64%. It also shows that there is a tradeoff between degree of accuracy and computation time. The increase in grid spacing will increase the computation time exponentially, while the increase in the number of point of interest will increase the computation time linearly.},   keywords={Internet of Things;optimisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication power management;Zigbee;ZigBee router node deployment;ZigBee based internet of things network;Internet of Things edge network;ZigBee network tree topology;ZigBee based network;energy efficient transceiver;physarum optimization algorithm;ZigBee;Optimization;Electron tubes;Logic gates;Internet of Things;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;ZigBee;router node deployment;tree construction;Physarum optimization},   doi={10.1109/ICTC.2017.8191057},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

In order to understand technological, and clinical context the proposed framework of this study is a synthesis of UTAUT, and HBM theories respectively, finally trust and doctor-patient relation factors are used to measure individual and patients' perspective about IoT-based health care systems. The proposed framework is validated with a pilot study of 40 respondents from five thickly populated cities of Pakistan. The findings verified that the proposed framework is appropriate to implement with empirical data. Based on the confirmation of the most familiar both theories, in health framework, this study demonstrates Perceived Health Risk which is composed of two independent factors, Perceived Susceptibility (PSS) and Perceived Severity (PS) have a significantly positive effect on cues to action. While in a technological context, Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Conditions (FC) have a jointly significant positive effect on cues to action to use behavior. Furthermore, both trust and doctor-patient relationship have also a positive effect on cues to action to use behavior. The instrument questionnaire adopted cluster sampling, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to validate and test the hypotheses.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={89-94},   abstract={In this paper, we present a novel design of an Internet of Things (IoT) and telemedicine based health monitoring system-The Smart Chair. Sensors and associated hardware needed to monitor the vital physiological parameters of the human body are available on the chair, thereby leading to the idea of a Smart Chair. It enables the subject to be seated in a relaxed posture during the acquisition of physiological signals from various sensors attached to his/her body. The raw signals from the sensors are processed digitally by an onboard microcontroller and analyzed for any common abnormalities in the health parameters of the subject. The results are then transmitted to a secured web server using a Wi-Fi module present in the system. The data can be viewed at any later time by a doctor from any remote location on his phone/ computer that is connected to Internet. The subject can also have the results transmitted to his/her own phone using a custom Android application which receives the data from the Smart Chair using Bluetooth. The snapshot of results along with the corresponding text file can be sent as an Email/ MMS to a remote doctor for a quick feedback. The Smart Chair also sends an SMS with all the health details to a remote doctor's phone in case of an emergency, thus facilitating telemedicine in rural areas. Throughout the design phase of the system, the cost was kept minimal. The key focus of the presented work is to propose the design of a product that will be useful and easily affordable by the people of developing nations who have limited access to proper healthcare facilities.

E-healthcare service is one of the important services for the crowdsourcing IoT applications that facilitates remote access or storage of medical server data to the authorized users (for example, doctors, patients, and nurses) via wireless communication. As wireless communication is susceptible to various kinds of threats and attacks, remote user authentication is highly essential for a hazard-free use of these services. In this paper, we aim to propose a new secure three-factor user remote user authentication protocol based on the extended chaotic maps. The three factors involved in the proposed scheme are: 1) smart card; 2) password; and 3) personal biometrics. As the proposed scheme avoids computationally expensive elliptic curve point multiplication or modular exponentiation operation, it is lightweight and efficient. The formal security verification using the widely-accepted verification tool, called the ProVerif 1.93, shows that the presented scheme is secure. In addition, we present the formal security analysis using the both widely accepted real-or-random model and Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic.

  year={2018},   volume={67},   number={10},   pages={9073-9086},   abstract={With the explosion in the number of connected devices and Internet of Things (IoT) services in smart city, the challenges to meet the demands from both data traffic delivery and information processing are increasingly prominent. Meanwhile, the connected vehicle networks have become an essential part in smart city, bringing massive data traffic as well as significant communication, caching, and computing resources. As the two typical services types in smart city, delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive traffic requires very different quality of service (QoS)/quality of experience (QoE), and could be delivered through the routes with different features to meet their QoS/QoE requirements with the lowest costs. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle network architecture in the smart city scenario, mitigating the network congestion with the joint optimization of networking, caching, and computing resources. Cloud computing at the data centers as well as mobile edge computing at the evolved node Bs and on-board units are taken as the paradigms to provide caching and computing resources. The programmable control principle originated from the software-defined networking paradigm has been introduced into this architecture to facilitate the system optimization and resource integration. With the careful modeling of the services, the vehicle mobility, and the system state, a joint resource management scheme is proposed and formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process to minimize the system cost, which consists of both network overhead and execution time of computing tasks. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters reveal that the proposed scheme could significantly improve the system performance compared to the existing schemes.},   keywords={Smart cities;Servers;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Network architecture;Task analysis;Connected vehicle network;Internet of Things;delay-tolerant data;mobile edge computing;software-defined networking;smart city},   doi={10.1109/TVT.2018.2865211},   ISSN={0018-9545},   month={Oct},}

In this paper, we propose a new e-Health platform driven by the needs of integrated diabetes care management. Architecture of this platform that is designed to be consistent with the concepts of Web-of-Things (WoT) comprises a physical sensors layer linked to a health Web-portal layer via an existing network infrastructure. The physical layer incorporates wireless nodes; each of which comprises a set of medical sensors linked wirelessly to a humanoid robot. Unlike existing e-Health systems, the proposed system is designed to support self-management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) not only through remote data collection and monitoring of patients data, but also through offering a support platform for real-time decisions and long-term social and behavioral change. These support services are delivered to the patients over a distance through daily patient-robot interactions that are either automatically generated be the system or assigned by specialist physicians. A prototype e-health platform which incorporates all these healthcare attributes is designed, implemented, and its end-to-end functionality is tested successfully with the aid of NHS collaborators.},   keywords={diseases;health care;humanoid robots;human-robot interaction;Internet of Things;medical robotics;patient care;portals;sensors;service robots;social aspects of automation;Web-of-Things inspired e-health platform;integrated diabetes care management;health care systems;WoT;physical sensor layer;health Web-portal layer;network infrastructure;physical layer;wireless nodes;medical sensors;humanoid robot;type 1 diabetes mellitus self-management;T1DM;remote data collection;patient data monitoring;real-time decisions;long-term social change;long-term behavioral change;patient-robot interactions;prototype e-health platform;end-to-end functionality;NHS collaborators;Diabetes;Monitoring;Robots;Sugar;Portals;Browsers;Behavioural change support;diabetes;mobile health;patient monitoring;Web-of-Things (WoT)},   doi={10.1109/AEECT.2013.6716427},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

The current development in CIoT is still elusive as it has to achieve effective interoperability and autonomous decision making. Most importantly, the decision theoretic models are seen as an enabler to achieve effective interoperability among heterogeneous CIoT objects.

In fact, in order to the new IoT serves human needs better, it has to take into account all sorts of psychological and emotional states. Smartphones present an excellent opportunity to do so as they are a key element in IoT and they contain several sensors that allow us to collect information about user movement, location, environment, and interactions with other people.

One of these is represented by suitably estimating blood pressure values of subjects in a continuous, real-time and non-invasive way. To address it, we propose an approach only requiring a photoplethysmography sensor and a mobile/desktop device. The approach avails itself of Genetic Programming to automatically find an explicit relationship between blood pressure values and photoplethysmography ones. This relationship is tested on a set of eleven subjects and compared against other regression methods, and turns out to be better. Namely, the Root Mean Square Error values are equal to 8.49 and 6.66 for the systolic and the diastolic BP values, respectively. Those for the relative error, instead, are equal to 5.55% for the systolic and 6.59% for the diastolic values.},   keywords={Monitoring;Medical services;Blood pressure;Biomedical monitoring;Real-time systems;Industries;Mathematical model;Health 4.0;continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring;photoplethysmography signal;computational intelligence;genetic programming},   doi={10.1109/TII.2018.2832081},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={},}

Through silicon via (TSV) has been utilized to minimize the distance between chips by vertically stacking chips in 3D-IC in some high-end products. It has been proved that a high data transmission, a wider bandwidth, a smaller footprint, and lower power consumption can be achieved. Meantime, TSV technologies possess many challenges such as high fabrication complexity and its unacceptable cost. Glass is an ideal interposer material due to its insulating property, large panel availability and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) match to silicon. Through glass vias (TGVs) fabrication is the key module to TGV interposer process integration. In this paper, processes, including TGVs etch, seed layer and Copper plating have been presented in detail. Through careful consideration and optimization of the above mentioned aspects, TGVs with 30um wide, 150um deep have been successfully fabricated. For TGVs fabrication, photosensitive glass was used to create the vias' area, and then wet etching was processed to get blind vias about 30um hole dimension and 150um depth. After high aspect ratio sputtering of Ti/Cu, copper full-filling was tested and no void was verified by X-ray image. For testing the integration ability of glass interposer, some inductors was fabricated on the glass wafer and its performance after the total processes was tested which Q factor was bigger than 45.},   keywords={copper;elemental semiconductors;etching;glass;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;Q-factor measurement;silicon;thermal expansion;three-dimensional integrated circuits;integrated process;high performance computing;Fifth-generation communication;IOT;high frequency loss;hole depth/dimension;vertical interconnections;3D-IC;high-end products;high data transmission;TSV technologies;high fabrication complexity;ideal interposer material;insulating property;panel availability;TGV interposer process integration;TGVs etch;seed layer;optimization;TGVs fabrication;photosensitive glass;high aspect ratio sputtering;integration ability;glass interposer;glass wafer;5G communication;Internet of Things applications;power consumption;coefficient of thermal expansion;CTE;through glass vias fabrication;copper plating;X-ray image;Q factor;Ti-Cu;Copper;Electronic mail;Three-dimensional displays;Filling;Through glass vias (TGVs);Seed layer;Copper electroplating;Inductor},   doi={10.1109/ICEPT.2017.8046709},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

In these applications, publishers (e.g. Smart devices, sensors) are continuously generating large volume of data with an extremely high throughput, whereas subscribers are only interested in a small portion of the data. Recently, content-based subscription systems have raised more and more attentions by the researchers where subscribers can specify rules on the content of messages that are composed of many attributes. For example, in traffic monitoring, an operator is only interested in the data within a specified area defined by constraints on latitude and longitude instead of the whole map. In this paper, we present COSS, the first Content-based Subscription Service for IoT with natural multi-tenant support and easy-to-use REST APIs. Moreover, we investigate in the problem of Balanced Rule Engine Partitioning for content-based subscription under the Tenant-Message-Rule (TMR) model. We show the NP-hardness of the problem and design a heuristics to enable COSS to adaptively adjust the message distribution according to the workload history, and to scale on both the high data throughput of IoT workloads and multi-tenant. Extensive experiments show that COSS offers high performance and scalability for content-based subscription in terms of the number of tenants, and the data throughput of the messages.},   keywords={application program interfaces;content-based retrieval;Internet of Things;middleware;optimisation;Web services;COSS;IoT service;Internet-Of-Things;environment monitoring;supply chain tracing;healthcare;vehicle networks;content-based subscription system;traffic monitoring;content-based subscription service;REST API;balanced rule engine partitioning;tenant-message-rule model;TMR model;NP-hard problem;message distribution;middleware;Web service;Engines;Servers;Throughput;Tunneling magnetoresistance;Filtering;Temperature sensors;Web service;IoT data management;content-based subscription;scalability},   doi={10.1109/ICWS.2015.56},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

However, while these two requirements are widely accepted by mobile carriers, they do not receive enough attention during the development. Current related research mainly focuses on audio feature analysis, which is costly, sensitive to language and tones, and infeasible to be applied to large-scale mobile networks. In this paper, we revisit this problem, and for the first time explore wireless network, the causal factor that directly impacts the mobile voice quality but yet lacks attention for decades. We design CrowdMi, a wireless analytical tool that model the mobile voice quality by crowdsourcing and mining the network indicators of cellphones. CrowdMi mines hundreds of network indicators to build a causal relationship between voice quality and network conditions, and carefully calibrates the model according to the widely accepted perceptual objective listening quality assessment (POLQA) voice assessment standard. We implement a light-load CrowdMi Client App in Android smartphones, which automatically collects data through user crowdsourcing and outputs to the CrowdMi Server in our data center that runs the mining algorithm. We conduct a pilot trial in VoLTE network in different geographical areas and network coverages. The trial shows that the CrowdMi does not require any additional hardware or human effort, and has very high model accuracy and strong diagnosability.},   keywords={data mining;hearing;human factors;Long Term Evolution;mobile handsets;telephony;VoLTE network;mining algorithm;data center;Android smartphones;CrowdMi Client App;POLQA voice assessment standard;perceptual objective listening quality assessment;cellphone network indicators;crowdsourcing;wireless analytical tool;wireless network;audio feature analysis;mobile carriers;mobile networks;wireless analytics;mobile voice quality assessment;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Quality assessment;Testing;Servers;Radio frequency;Training;;Crowdsourcing;data mining;LTE;voice quality},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2014.2387771},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Wearable sensor devices are playing an increasingly important role in providing pervasive and personalized healthcare. Important elements of modern healthcare services are physical rehabilitation and injury prevention. Wearable sensor devices attached to the patient can offer valuable supplemental information to healthcare professionals during treatment or therapy. In physical rehabilitation, wearable inertial sensor devices help therapists to monitor and evaluate parameters and key performance indicators of the rehabilitation activities. Therapy efficiency can be increased by using real-time feedback systems. Three different feedback system architectures are defined and studied: therapist, user, and cloud system. A case study involving rehabilitation therapy based on swimming exercises was performed. Field test results show that the developed sensor device and real-time therapist feedback application provide sufficiently accurate and precise data for the efficient evaluation of swimming parameters, such as stroke time and stroke rotation angle symmetry. Rehabilitation therapists should be able to operate the system without the constant presence of trained and experienced technical personnel (engineers). The wide adoption of wearable sensor device based applications will lead to cloud systems where big data analytics will offer additional benefits to healthcare, well-being, and quality of life.},   keywords={Medical services;Biomedical monitoring;Wearable sensors;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;wearable sensor device;healthcare;swimming rehabilitation;real-time feedback.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2850664},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

The adaptability feature characterizing the protocol is essential in handling different patients' health states. PEAM was designed based on cross-layer constructs that allow across the layers synchronization and coordination orchestrated by the application layer and targeting the Data link layer services.

IoT architectures contribute to critical aspects of our society like transportation, health-care, industry, telecommunications and many others. Security is difficult to be implemented in the IoT context because the embedded devices are resource constrained and deployed in uncontrolled areas, thus being targeted by various security attacks. In scenarios like smart city, IoT networks are populated by both trusted and untrusted transient devices, thus mechanisms for mitigating complex security attacks must be implemented. Embedded networks with near real-time constraints are subject to denial-of-service attacks which can easily affect the applications availability by injecting malicious packets into the network.

IoT can play a significant role in healthcare domain by managing chronic diseases at one end as well as preventing diseases on the other hand. People demand more care at reduced clinical costs, remote health monitoring (using IoT) is one of the possible solutions to this demand. Remote health monitoring can be best utilized provided the device is wearable to facilitate self-monitoring. In this paper, we propose a system for monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature (vital body parameters) of the person with dedicated sensors along with Raspberry pi and IoT. A system is wearable and also supports remote health monitoring. Remote Health monitoring is attained by storing the collected data to Bluemix cloud, this data can be retrieved by the doctor for analysis anywhere and any aberrancy will be timely detected. Bluemixuses MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. Along with remote monitoring and wearability of system, accuracy and cost cannot be ignored. A perfect tradeoff between accuracy and cost of the system is accomplished by choosing appropriate sensors which are DS18B20 (temperature sensor) and KG011 (heart rate sensor). The pulse rate and temperature of a person at different time instants are measured by the sensors. The readings are shown in the form of graphs at IBM Watson IoT platform.},   keywords={Android (operating system);cloud computing;computerised monitoring;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;patient monitoring;temperature sensors;transport protocols;remote health monitoring;Raspberry pi;medical science;Internet of Things;reduced clinical costs;pulse rate monitoring;body temperature;vital body parameters;Bluemix cloud;Bluemixuses MQTT;message queuing telemetry transport protocol;heart rate sensor;DS18B20;KG011;IBM Watson IoT platform;Temperature sensors;Medical services;Temperature measurement;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Sensor systems;Healthcare System;Internet of Things;Arduino UNO;Raspberry pi;cloud computing;IBM Bluemix cloud service},   doi={10.1109/CCAA.2017.8230004},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

To the best of our knowledge, iGuiding is the first campus care and guidance system which provides the following features: 1) it achieves the seamless outdoor and indoor navigation between buildings in a campus, 2) it keeps additional construction cost low by utilizing existing surveillance cameras in a campus, and 3) it reduces the total searching time for finding a specific event/target in a campus by alleviating time-consuming labor overhead to review a huge amount of video data.

 title={Session Resumption-Based End-to-End Security for Healthcare Internet-of-Things}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={581-588},   abstract={In this paper, a session resumption-based end-to-end security scheme for healthcare Internet of things (IoT) is pro-posed. The proposed scheme is realized by employing certificate-based DTLS handshake between end-users and smart gateways as well as utilizing DTLS session resumption technique. Smart gateways enable the sensors to no longer need to authenticate and authorize remote end-users by handing over the necessary security context. Session resumption technique enables end-users and medical sensors to directly communicate without the need for establishing the communication from the initial handshake. Session resumption technique has an abbreviated form of DTLS handshake and neither requires certificate-related nor public-key funtionalities. This alleviates some burden of medical sensors tono longer need to perform expensive operations. The energy-performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are evaluated by developing a remote patient monitoring prototype based on healthcare IoT. The energy-performance evaluation results show that our scheme is about 97% and 10% faster than certificate-based and symmetric key-based DTLS, respectively. Also, the certificate-based DTLS consumes about 2.2X more RAM and 2.9X more ROM resources required by our scheme. While, our scheme and symmetric key-based DTLS have almost similar RAM and ROM requirements. The security analysis reveals that the proposed scheme fulfills the requirements of end-to-end security and provides higher security level than related approaches found in the literature. Thus, the presented scheme is a well-suited solution to provide end-to-end security for healthcare IoT.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;public key cryptography;end-to-end security;healthcare Internet-of-Things;IoT;smart gateways;DTLS session resumption technique;remote end-users;security context;session resumption technique;medical sensors;public key funtionalities;energy performance evaluations;remote patient monitoring prototype;Conferences;Computers;Information technology;Ubiquitous computing},   doi={10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.83},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

In Internet of Things, systems aim to satisfy users by assigning suitable process sequence to massive services under users' dynamic influence. However, it's hard to achieve this goal if users' dynamic influence is not carefully considered. Users influence services by whether they purchase the services or not. And, users' mutable purchase orders lead to dynamic influence. So, in this paper, we focus on users' dynamic influence and propose a dynamic priority assignment algorithm through service data distribution forecasting and user satisfaction based regulation. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm performs better than fixed priority assignment algorithm which assigns priorities by pre-defined, fixed rules in adjusting to users' dynamic influence on services and guaranteeing a high user satisfaction.},   keywords={human factors;Internet of Things;user satisfaction based regulation;service data distribution forecasting;Internet of Things;user satisfaction-based dynamic priority assignment algorithm;Heuristic algorithms;Forecasting;Internet of things;Sorting;Software algorithms;Software;Electronic mail;user satisfaction;dynamic user influence;dynamic priority assignment;Internet of Things;IoT service},   doi={10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.225},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Once the daily activities are recognized, we translate this information into energy expenditure using the compendium of physical activities. By successfully detecting 8 physical activities at 90%, we reached an overall accuracy of 80% in recognizing 17 different daily activities.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Fog computing has appeared as a favorable technology that can bring cloud applications closer to the physical IoT devices at the network edge but there is neither a common fog computing architecture or how it supports real-time Internet of Things (IoT) service execution. Edge devices such as the switch, router, gateway, mobile phones, smart car etc., are the candidates for deployment of fog nodes but the deployment differs according to the application. In this work, we have taken gateways as candidates for fog node deployment. The gateway collects data from smart sensors, but it does not have any pre-processing or decision-making capabilities. Therefore, the gateway is made smarter with Fog capabilities and named as Fog Smart Gateway (FSG).

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={154-159},   abstract={Reusing of code has been a very common practice in software development. This practice has been implemented to reduce programming time and efforts greatly. This copying and pasting behavior of programmers leads to cloning of codes and therefore has a very serious impact on the maintenance of the software systems. Many clone detection tool has been proposed to find out the copied code. However, refactoring of code is still a challenging part as most of the ongoing tools depend on detection of clone rather than the ability to make decision on refactorability. These tools do not guarantee whether such codes can be safely refactored or not. Our aim mainly lies on detecting the possibility of refactoring a code. To find out whether the code clone can be securely refactored or not, three methods are applied: Nesting Structure Mapping, Statement Mapping and Precondition Examination. In order to refactor the code, we apply some techniques like Pull-Up Method and Push-Down Method. In our approach, we have tried to find the refactorable code using the methods and also refactored the code so as to remove the problem of code cloning.},   keywords={graph theory;program compilers;software maintenance;qualitative approach;code clone opportunities refactoring;code clone opportunities;tree methods;graph methods;software development;software systems;software maintenance;copied code;nesting structure mapping;statement mapping;precondition examination;pull-up method;push down method;Cloning;Programming;Maintenance engineering;Computer bugs;Debugging;Software systems;Code clones;clone detection;Refactoring;Nesting Structure Mapping;Statement Mapping;Precondition Examination},   doi={10.1109/INCITE.2016.7857608},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={452-457},   abstract={With the more and more serious population aging problem, the demand of long-term care is increasing. Actually, most of the aging people have the ability to take care of themselves, some warm concerns, medical advices, and timely remainders can effectively improve their living quality. Therefore, an automatic system to track and record elderly people's daily life and activities is required. In this paper, we propose a Long-term cArE-based Smart hOme platform (LAESO), which integrates the cloud, IoT, sensor networks, and community. The proposed LAESO platform combines with a variety of services, such as motion detection, activity detection and log, e-Care, indoor positioning, location-based real-time video monitoring, emergency notification, and lost elderly searching. Detected motions and activities of the elderly will be logged on to the cloud platform. With the log, e-Care can produce graphics and charts by doing statistics. Accordingly, family members and caregivers are able to understand the daily life and activity changes of the elderly. Moreover, we integrate the particle filter and 9-axis sensor to provide indoor positioning. LAESO platform also develops the emergency notification and location-based real-time video monitoring services to handle emergency events, i.e., the elderly falls down. Finally, we propose a novel lost elderly searching method, which combines the GPS positioning and crowd sensing to help find the missing elderly. Our real prototyping experience and some experimental results are also reported.},   keywords={cloud computing;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;cloud computing;Internet-of-Things;IoT;lost elderly searching;long-term care-based smart home platform;LAESO;motion detection;activity detection;indoor positioning;location-based real-time video monitoring;emergency notification;GPS positioning;crowd sensing;Senior citizens;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Global Positioning System;Home appliances;Real-time systems;Wireless sensor networks;long-term care;Internet of Things (IoT);cloud computing;crowd sensing;Bluetooth Indoor Positioning},   doi={10.1109/ICS.2016.0097},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

In fact, depending on the specific application, tags must satisfy key requirements in terms of size, thickness, shape, robustness, cost, working range, bandwidth, antenna directivity, platform tolerance, polarization, and so on. In such a scenario, the design of a specific application-oriented tag by an RF designer as well as the careful selection among commercially available solutions by system integrators rather than final users needs a dedicated measurement system enabling a rapid and cost-effective procedure for the on-air performance evaluation of RFID tags. Nevertheless, the design of such a system is not trivial, as tag performance depends on multiple major factors, such as chip sensitivity, quality of the chip-antenna conjugate matching, and antenna radiation properties. In this paper, after a theoretical formulation, an accurate, flexible, robust, and cost-effective RFID tag characterization and performance evaluation platform is presented and validated. It allows the calculation of the main metrics characterizing an RFID tag as a function of the tag activation power threshold when varying both interrogation frequency and tag orientation. The system is validated on both specifically designed and commercial RFID tags in terms of sensitivity, working range, and tag antenna radiation pattern: measurements show strong agreement with the theoretical and simulation results.},   keywords={antenna radiation patterns;electric variables measurement;magnetic variables measurement;radiofrequency identification;tag orientation;interrogation frequency;tag activation power threshold;antenna directivity radiation property;chip-antenna conjugate matching;measurement system;application-oriented tag;polarization;platform tolerance;passive UHF RFID tag;Internet of Things;radiofrequency identification;electromagnetic measurement platform;Radiofrequency identification;Sensitivity;Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna measurements;UHF antennas;Internet of Things (IoT);radiation pattern;radio-frequency identification (RFID);read range;sensitivity;tag;tag antenna;UHF.;Internet of Things (IoT);radiation pattern;radio-frequency identification (RFID);read range;sensitivity;tag;tag antenna;UHF},   doi={10.1109/TIM.2016.2516322},   ISSN={0018-9456},   month={April},}

Recently, a new concept has emerged in relation with SG: transactive energy - a framework to integrate and coordinate multiple independent suppliers of electric services in an economic marketplace that enables purchases in a way that obeys the physical constrains of the underlying energy grid. Our team is developing a transactive energy framework called Open Access Smart Grids (OASIS).

Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel proxy-based authentication and key establishment protocol, which is lightweight and suitable to safeguard sensitive data generated by resource-constrained devices in IoT-enabled AAL systems.},   keywords={assisted living;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;geriatrics;health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;key establishment protocol;proxy-based authentication protocol;security protocol;cryptographic operation;critical health data accessment;remote server;remote host;medical device;user privacy;user security;elderly people;Internet of Things technology;IoT-enabled ambient assisted living system;constrained device;secure end-to-end communication link;Protocols;Sensors;Cryptography;DH-HEMTs;Senior citizens;Authentication;Internet of Things;authentication;key establishment;proxy;resource-constrained device},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389141},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={384-391},   abstract={E-health represents an attractive application for the Internet of Things. It improves the quality of medical services by allowing periodic patient diagnostics. As it collects and sends sensitive biomedical information, both content and contextual privacy requirements must be satisfied. Content privacy ensures the protection of patient information against inappropriate disclosure. Contextual privacy is about the context of the communication. Several privacy-preserving approaches have been proposed. However, they only consider content privacy requirement. To fill this gap, we propose in this paper a new privacy preserving scheme adapted to e-Health systems, satisfying all privacy requirements, as well as communication security and authentication. Content privacy is based on cryptographic primitives. Contextual privacy relies on the onion routing concept, fake messages injection and a multicast strategy. To validate our proposal, a security and performance analysis are reported. The security analysis confirms its safety and proves its resistance to a set of security attacks. The performance analysis highlights the trade-off between privacy and efficiency.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;security of data;Internet of Things;periodic patient diagnostics;sensitive biomedical information;contextual privacy;patient information;privacy-preserving approaches;content privacy requirement;privacy requirements;eHealth systems;communication security;authentication;authentication;onion routing concept;fake messages injection;multicast strategy;security attacks;Privacy;Medical services;Public key;Sensors;Payloads;Internet of Things;Security and Privacy;Content privacy;Contextual privacy;e-Health;ns-3},   doi={10.1109/AICCSA.2017.75},   ISSN={2161-5330},   month={Oct},}

 title={UbeHealth: A Personalized Ubiquitous Cloud and Edge-Enabled Networked Healthcare System for Smart Cities}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={32258-32285},   abstract={Smart city advancements are driving massive transformations of healthcare, the largest global industry. The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers. Three widely used data sets are used to evaluate the UbeHealth system.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;mobile computing;parallel processing;protocols;quality of service;smart cities;smart cities;mobile cloud computing;future healthcare demands;network latency;next-generation healthcare;ubiquitous healthcare framework;edge computing;deep learning;high-performance computing;HPC;network traffic;network layers;data rates;data caching;application protocols;anomalous data;Big Data;UbeHealth system;personalized ubiquitous cloud computing;edge-enabled networked healthcare system;personalized healthcare;patient data analysis;reliability;Internet of Things;IoT;enhanced network quality of service;routing decisions;traffic flows;malicious traffic detection;Medical services;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Quality of service;Machine learning;Smart cities;Internet of Things;Cloudlets;deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);mobile edge computing;mobile healthcare;preventive healthcare;traffic classification;traffic prediction;survey;fog computing;cloud computing;multimedia applications;smart cities},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846609},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This leads to e-health system that, in real time manner, supplies a valuable set of information relevant to all of the stakeholders (patients, medical and paramedical stuff, and health insurance) regardless their current location.

RF far-field power transfer is a potential technique for wirelessly powering these sensors since it offers flexible configuration of sensor networks, beamforming capability and a large power transfer range compared to near-field approaches. However, system design for RF power transfer needs to be completely rethought to enable this new paradigm of a trillion IoT sensors. This paper, therefore, presents a comprehensive, system-level analysis strategy and a modular framework for investigating the fundamental efficiency components in an RF power transfer chain. Through this detailed analysis, it is demonstrated that the optimal frequency is primarily determined by the antenna size and the quality factors (Q) of components in the matching network. Millimeter-wave frequencies are shown to be optimal for powering mm-sized sensors for practical matching component Q values.

In addition, many sport clubs and sport academies spend millions of dollars contracting new professional footballers or even developing new professional footballers. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines various technologies to enhance our lives. Today's technology can protect footballers by diagnosing any health problems, which may occur during the match or training session, which, if detected early, may prevent any adverse effects on their long-term health. This paper proposes an IoT-based architecture for the sport of football, called IoT Football.

One probable commonality in each of these services will be the abundance of different types of data from different sources with the success of the systems depending on real-time or near real-time analysis of data. Such analyses are normally performed via well-known algorithms with a time-constraint on the execution, thus creating a requirement for parallel execution techniques. Some of these analyses may have a higher frequency of execution on a relatively small set of data, in which case the current big-data frameworks may actually add an overhead. Further, the frameworks like Hadoop demand the algorithms to be mapped onto a particular paradigm, which may not always be a suitable option. This paper, which is a work-in-progress, provides an experience report on the use of Condor, a well known Grid framework, for data-parallel “black-box” style execution of analysis algorithms in the context of Internet of Things.

Moreover, having fun while learning is of great interest to dyslexic children because it reduces stress and helps them focus and concentrate, which may be difficult for them because of their condition. Touching and manipulating letters may also improve their reading skills. The application this article deals with is a physical support on which children can place and move 3D letters in order to reproduce the word they are seeing. In this study, we embed in each learning component a WSN. For each WSN, we select a kind of master which is connected to the Internet. We will then handle a network of WSNs to build a backbone to investigate the thinking pattern of each child. This investigation could be monitored by a doctor from her/his office without disrupting her/his work. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a model in order to detect if dyslexic children could read more efficiently if a 3D view of words was proposed to them.

However, large-scale trials are uncovering key areas that inhibit long-term large-scale deployments, including power consumption and lifetime issues, and high communication overhead. Traditional techniques can efficiently resolve these issues while maintaining semantic fidelity of the sensed medical signal, but also amplify the signal's sensitivity to sensor faults, thereby reducing system safety. We propose a set of statistical techniques to optimize system power and bandwidth consumption, while adhering to signal fidelity and sensor fault diagnosis requirements. By defining signal fidelity in terms of its semantic value, and formulating the problem as a sensor subset selection wherein mutual information rather than aggregate signal quality is maximized, we show that power consumption in a wireless human gait monitoring system can be reduced by up to 78% while accurately estimating many functional gait assessment metrics and precisely diagnosing semantic faults.},   keywords={body area networks;fault diagnosis;gait analysis;health care;low-power electronics;mobile radio;patient monitoring;statistical analysis;wireless sensor networks;low-power semantic fault-detection;multisensory mobile health monitoring systems;healthcare;power consumption;statistical techniques;bandwidth consumption;sensor fault diagnosis;signal fidelity;wireless human gait monitoring system;Decision support systems;Internet;Fault Detection;Sensor Coverage;Energy-Efficient Sampling;Body Area Networks},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803112},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Avoidance of healthcare monitoring negatively results in many aspects. Among the extensive applications enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), digital health care is a mainly essential one. Internet of Things (IoT) provides a new life to the healthcare field. One of the better ways is where the doctors are able to certainly and quickly use the relevant patient information through the help of internet of things to take suitable actions. This tremendously improves the quality of information and the patient care in the Medical field. So, Internet of Things offers a concrete platform to connect all the resources and improve the quality of life. The proposed system presents a personal healthcare system that is both flexible and scalable. Making use of embedded wearable sensors, the system monitors the health parameters dynamically.

This implementation of RPL is designed with a new dynamic Objective-Function (D-OF) to improve the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay and energy consumption while maintaining low packet overhead and loop-avoidance. We propose a controlled reverse-trickle timer based on received signal strength identification (RSSI) readings to maintain high responsiveness with minimum overhead and consult the objective function when a movement or an inconsistency is detected to help nodes make an informed decision. Simulations are done using Cooja with random waypoint mobility scenario for healthcare applications considering multi-hop routing.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={762-775},   abstract={The end of Dennard's scaling and the looming power wall have made power and energy primary design goals for modern processors. Further, new applications such as cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) continue to necessitate increased performance and energy efficiency. Manycore processors show potential in addressing some of these issues. However, there is little detailed power and energy data on manycore processors. In this work, we carefully study detailed power and energy characteristics of Piton, a 25-core modern open source academic processor, including voltage versus frequency scaling, energy per instruction (EPI), memory system energy, network-on-chip (NoC) energy, thermal characteristics, and application performance and power consumption. This is the first detailed power and energy characterization of an open source manycore design implemented in silicon. The open source nature of the processor provides increased value, enabling detailed characterization verified against simulation and the ability to correlate results with the design and register transfer level (RTL) model. Additionally, this enables other researchers to utilize this work to build new power models, devise new research directions, and perform accurate power and energy research using the open source processor. The characterization data reveals a number of interesting insights, including that operand values have a large impact on EPI, recomputing data can be more energy efficient than loading it from memory, on-chip data transmission (NoC) energy is low, and insights on energy efficient multithreaded core design.

  year={2018},   volume={22},   number={6},   pages={1711-1719},   abstract={Facial expressions are among behavioral signs of pain that can be employed as an entry point to develop an automatic human pain assessment tool. Such a tool can be an alternative to the self-report method and particularly serve patients who are unable to self-report like patients in the intensive care unit and minors. In this paper, a wearable device with a biosensing facial mask is proposed to monitor pain intensity of a patient by utilizing facial surface electromyogram (sEMG). The wearable device works as a wireless sensor node and is integrated into an Internet of Things (IoT) system for remote pain monitoring. In the sensor node, up to eight channels of sEMG can be each sampled at 1000 Hz, to cover its full frequency range, and transmitted to the cloud server via the gateway in real time. In addition, both low energy consumption and wearing comfort are considered throughout the wearable device design for long-term monitoring. To remotely illustrate real-time pain data to caregivers, a mobile web application is developed for real-time streaming of high-volume sEMG data, digital signal processing, interpreting, and visualization. The cloud platform in the system acts as a bridge between the sensor node and web browser, managing wireless communication between the server and the web application. In summary, this study proposes a scalable IoT system for real-time biopotential monitoring and a wearable solution for automatic pain assessment via facial expressions.},   keywords={Pain;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Cloud computing;Servers;Mobile communication;Tools;Biopotential sensor node;cloud computing;healthcare internet-of-things (IoT);pain assessment;wearable sensors;web-based UI for IoT applications},   doi={10.1109/JBHI.2017.2776351},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={Nov},}

Researchers or developers associated with these domains frequently require diverse types of IoT devices to implement or test their IoT related innovations. However, building an IoT-testbed by purchasing these IoT devices in every few months is infeasible considering that most of them will be used only for a small amount of time and will become obsolete with the arrival of an upgraded version of those devices. Instead, a better approach would be rented out the IoT devices in on-demand, just-in-time, and pay for only the time the devices are used basis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose IoTbed - an architecture to deliver a large scale Testbed as a service using the IoT devices located in the users' proximal networks. IoTbed enables testbed providers to build their testbeds in the edge of the network and allows easy and secure access for IoT service providers to run experiments on those testbeds. IoTbed presents an economic model that offers monetary incentives to the device owners for using their devices in the testbed experiments. We posit that such an incentive model will encourage more testbed providers to rent out their smart devices through IoTbed.

The effective collection of measures of PA in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers and patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method remarkably improves the validity of PA measures in a healthcare platform.},   keywords={health care;Internet of Things;medical computing;PA measure;health care platform;validity improvement method;health care collaboration;interdisciplinary health care research;IoT environment;Internet of Things environment;life-logging physical activity measure;ellipse fitting model},   doi={10.1049/iet-net.2015.0109},   ISSN={2047-4954},   month={},}

However interoperability within different healthcare systems (clinics/hospitals/pharmacies) remains an issue of further research due to a lack of collaboration and exchange of healthcare information. To solve this problem, cross healthcare system collaboration is required. This paper proposes a conceptual semantic based healthcare collaboration framework based on Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure that is able to offer a secure cross system information and knowledge exchange between different healthcare systems seamlessly that is readable by both machines and humans. In the proposed framework, an intelligent semantic gateway is introduced where a web application with restful Application Programming Interface (API) is used to expose the healthcare information of each system for collaboration. A case study that exposed the patient's data between two different healthcare systems was practically demonstrated where a pharmacist can access the patient's electronic prescription from the clinic.},   keywords={application program interfaces;health care;hospitals;Internet;Internet of Things;medical information systems;open systems;healthcare systems interoperability;healthcare cost;healthcare service quality;healthcare information;cross healthcare system collaboration;secure cross system information;intelligent semantic gateway;information and communications technology;ICTs;medical errors minimization;Internet of Things infrastructure;IoT;Web application;application programming interface;API;patients electronic prescription;semantic based healthcare collaboration framework;hospitals;clinics;pharmacies;Medical services;Interoperability;Semantics;Logic gates;Standards;Collaboration;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Healthcare Interoperability;Smart Gateway;Semantic Web;Ontology;Sensor Networks},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2018.00060},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Intermittent security copes with unreliable network connections, and flexibility is achieved through security configurations that are tailored to application needs.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={206-211},   abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, people are very interested in wearable devices such as smart watches. These devices measure individual physiological time series such as blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG. With this functionality, people can check the status of their own health. This healthcare service usually sends individual physiological time series to remote clusters for calculation. A remote healthcare service is particularly necessary for patients suffering from chronic and urgent diseases such as cardiovascular disease. It is also necessary to predict urgent signals for proper treatment. One method to predict urgent signals is by clustering physiological time series and comparing the new physiological time series with the previous time series in a cluster. It means searching the time series similar to risk features. In other words, the detection and comparison of features in time series are important. Therefore, in this study, we propose a biosignal processing system based on the Haar transform of time series in IoT applications. We discuss the validity of this system according to various perspectives. The Haar transform of a time series reflects the trend of the time series; thus, we can recognize the trend of the time series more easily. In addition, we can reduce the storage size of the time series. This is especially helpful because the volume of a time series is massive in the IoT era. Although the reduction of information in a time series can distort the similarity accuracy, it does not distort it significantly.},   keywords={cardiology;cardiovascular system;diseases;electroencephalography;Haar transforms;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;time series;individual physiological time series;biosignal processing system;Haar Transform;IoT application;Internet of Things;blood pressure;heart rate;EEG;chronic diseases;urgent diseases;cardiovascular disease;Time series analysis;Transforms;Correlation;Physiology;Medical services;Market research;Euclidean distance;time series;correlation;Haar wavelet;Haar transform;distance measure;clustering;healthcare;IoT},   doi={10.1109/BIBE.2017.00-54},   ISSN={2471-7819},   month={Oct},}

Our proposed system consists of mechanical, electrical and communication components integrated with IoT (Internet of Things). The mechanical part consists of the stepper motor controlled by the Raspberry Pi B+ via web interface, which can dispense food pellets via appropriate rotations of the container containing the food pellets as per the care-taker's preference. The electrical part consists of a Raspberry Pi B+ module and a pi-camera, which provides web interface and the realtime video data collection of fish. The web interface consists of the user fixed scheduling, feeding data, live streaming of fish, etc. There are two modes of feeding-remotely (manual) by web interface or via pre-scheduled feeding time set by the care-taker. In scheduled feeding, the care-taker must fix the schedule in the web page. In the manual feeding, the user must feed the fish remotely via the web interface. In short, the module can be used for scheduled feeding of the fish or remotely feed via web interface.},   keywords={Fish;Feeds;Monitoring;Containers;Streaming media;Conferences;Manuals;Web-based;IoT;Stepper motor;Raspberry Pi B+;pi-camera;Scheduled feed;Remote feed},   doi={10.1109/ICECA.2018.8474829},   ISSN={},   month={March},}

Fall leads to major injuries, physical disability and sometimes death. Therefore, there is a need to design a dependable embedded system device which will help in detecting the fall and further sends an emergency notification and thus helps in preventing the fall. Many researchers have considered human fall as an unpredictable danger to the life of older generation. Hence lot of research has been done in this area to develop a fall detection system. The existing fall detection systems are efficient but they lack in sensor optimization, early fall detection and efficient wireless communication. In this study, we have demonstrated a pre-fall detection system which detects human falls approximately 250 ms before it occurs. Early fall detection helps in preventing the subject from serious injuries. The designed system monitors user balanced and unbalanced state. Once the unbalance state is detected the system signifies it as a fall, thus gives milliseconds of time to trigger the safety devices like wearable airbag worn by a subject. On fall the system sends emergency notification to the care taker using either Internet of things (IoT) or Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The Hardware system is designed such that it consumes low power and it is a dependable embedded system with easy to wear capabilities for the subject. The designed system uses Arm Processor associated with motion sensors, communication sensors, Signal sensor and MicroSD Card. The software and hardware combination was developed to get optimal low power consumption by switching the CPU between active and sleep mode. The practical experiments performed on the designed system results in giving the 100% sensitivity and 98.07% specificity for fall detection. The wireless communication is efficiently designed such that the power is consumed only when the fall is triggered.

Internet of Things uses the virtue of connecting this data from different entities and creates a pool of knowledge for providing smart services to users, based on rigorous analysis and processing over the knowledge. The communication in this context scales to not only between machine to machine but also between a large number of heterogeneous entities and persons. This genius technology of Internet of Things holds paramount importance and application in healthcare technologies. Considering health technologies, a large number of devices generate huge amount of data related to a patient. Assimilating the data from heterogeneous sources and using it to generate intelligence is one of the primary tasks in a smart environment. In the context of eHealth, Internet of Things is of immense importance since connected data about patient would facilitate treatment with more efficiency and comprehensive knowledge. Virtually storing the patient data and making it ubiquitously accessible to concerned healthcare personnel would be the first step toward mutual knowledge sharing. Another important aspect of using this connected data is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system which would assist the doctors in every possible way during the treatment phase. A model has been proposed with an inclusive approach of Internet of Things in eHealth scenario for a smart medical environment and providing ubiquitous services at its best. Several issues pertaining to the system has also been discussed accordingly.

The related sensed data/information will be sent for the necessary information exchange together with the design and optimized parameters. This research paper is focused on integrating the architecture of WSN in an energy efficient manner in IoT perspective, cloud computing for a healthcare application. The proposed architecture, the health care system could be improvised with Quality of Experience (QoE), trust management, decision making and energy management. The health care services could be implemented to all the hospitals collectively, with insurance companies to provide centralized, secure access to patient information with the health monitoring of every patient. This proposed integration seems to be an aid for the IoT applications where the energy, QoE is in demand.},   keywords={cloud computing;decision making;health care;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;dynamic network infrastructure;related sensed data/information;design;WSN;cloud computing;health care services;patient information;health monitoring;IoT applications;generic health care system;IoT environment;wireless sensor networks;information exchange;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Wireless sensor networks;Medical services;Computer architecture;Wireless communication;Hardware;Protocols;IoT;WSN;cloud;Energy},   doi={10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211698},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

As most IoT devices carry constrained resources and limited storage capacity, sensing data need to be transmitted to and stored at resource-rich platforms, such as a cloud. IoT applications retrieve sensing data from the cloud for analysis and decision-making purposes. Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the sensing data is essential for the correctness and safety of IoT applications. We summarize the new challenges of the IoT data communication framework with authenticity and integrity and argue that existing solutions cannot be easily adopted. We present two solutions, called Dynamic Tree Chaining (DTC) and Geometric Star Chaining (GSC) that provide authenticity, integrity, sampling uniformity, system efficiency, and application flexibility to IoT data communication. Extensive simulations and prototype emulation experiments driven by real IoT data show that the proposed system is more efficient than alternative solutions in terms of time and space.},   keywords={computer network security;Internet of Things;IoT data communication framework;authenticity;integrity;Internet of Things;transportation;healthcare;smart homes;IoT devices;limited storage capacity;decision-making;dynamic tree chaining;DTC;geometric star chaining;GSC;Sensors;Cloud computing;Data communication;Big Data applications;Digital signatures;Cryptography;IoT;Cloud;Authentication;Partial Data Retrieval;Sample},   doi={},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

This IoT/M2M connectivity technology is deployed at the sub-1 GHz ISM bands, that are subject to various coexistence regulations set by the authorities. In Europe, devices in the Sub-1 GHz ISM bands must comply with the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%, provided that they also support Listen Before Talk (LBT) and Adaptive Frequency Agility (AFA) features. In this article we investigate the challenges of such duty cycle limitation and its effect on the IEEE 802.11ah network performance from the uplink transmission perspective, considering typical use cases characterized by different traffic models. We first derive the theoretical maximum duty cycles of both an individual station and an individual AP assuming full-buffer or saturated traffic. Then, with emphasis on more practical uses cases, such as home/building automation and healthcare, where the traffic of an individual station or node is strongly unsaturated, we analyze the IEEE 802.11ah network performance without and with the 2.8% maximum duty cycle limitation. The obtained results show IEEE 802.11ah networks can provide efficient support for the most important use cases such as sensor networking, home automation and healthcare, despite the maximum duty cycle limit of 2.8%. This shows that IEEE 802.11ah is one of the most prominent and scalable IoT/M2M connectivity technology, that can enable different types of IoT applications, even in the presence of the tight coexistence requirements at the ISM band.},   keywords={},   doi={},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2018},   volume={15},   number={2},   pages={611-624},   abstract={In response to the growing demand for cellular networks, it is essential to improve the capacity of mobile core networks. Especially, in terms of accommodating machine-to-machine/Internet-of-Things (M2M/IoT) terminals into cellular networks, the load on the control and the user planes of the mobile core network increases massively. To deal with this problem, it is possible to apply virtualization technologies, such as software-defined network and network function virtualization. However, few existing studies evaluate such solutions for mobile core networks numerically and in detail. In this paper, we first evaluate mobile core network architectures with virtualization technologies and control/user (C/U) plane separation using the mathematical analysis. We also propose a novel bearer aggregation method to reduce the control plane load to accommodate massive M2M/IoT terminals. The result of numerical evaluation shows that the capacity of the mobile core network can be increased by up to 32.8% with node virtualization and C/U plane separation, and further by 201.4% by using bearer aggregation. Moreover, to maintain the performance of the mobile core network, we should carefully determine where the bearer aggregation is applied and when the shared bearer for each terminal is determined based on application characteristics and the number of accommodated M2M/IoT terminals.},   keywords={cellular radio;Internet of Things;machine-to-machine communication;software defined networking;virtualisation;mobile core network architectures;C/U plane separation;bearer aggregation;cellular networks;machine-to-machine/Internet-of-Things terminals;network function virtualization;mobile core network;software-defined network;Mobile computing;Virtualization;Computer architecture;Cellular networks;Cloud computing;Network architecture;Mobile core network;M2M/IoT communication;software defined networks;C/U plane separation;bearer aggregation},   doi={10.1109/TNSM.2018.2797301},   ISSN={1932-4537},   month={June},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1112-1116},   abstract={This paper develops a control framework for a network of energy harvesting nodes connected to a Base Station (BS) over a multiple access channel. Due to fluctuations in energy availability and, possibly, energy outages, the number of nodes attempting channel access is random and varies over time. Thus, each node must carefully adapt its access probability to the network state to optimize network performance. In order to reduce the complexity of network control, a lightweight and flexible design framework is proposed where energy storage dynamics are replaced by dynamic average power constraints at each node, induced by the time correlated energy supply. The BS adapts the access probability of the “active” nodes (those currently under a favorable energy harvesting state) so as to maximize throughput. The resulting policy takes the form of access probability as a function of the local energy harvesting state and number of active nodes. The structure of the throughput-optimal policy is analytically derived for the genie-aided case of non-causal knowledge of the number of active nodes. Inspired by it, a Bayesian estimation approach is presented for the more practical scenario where the BS estimates the number of active nodes. The proposed scheme is shown to outperform by 20% a scheme in which the nodes operate based only on local state information, and to be robust against the impact of energy storage dynamics at a fraction of the complexity.},   keywords={energy harvesting;Internet of Things;multi-access systems;probability;wide area networks;energy-based adaptive multiple access channel;LPWAN IoT systems;energy harvesting;access probability;local energy harvesting state;throughput-optimal policy;Bayesian estimation approach;Energy harvesting;Batteries;Complexity theory;Optimization;Throughput;Logic gates},   doi={10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006701},   ISSN={2157-8117},   month={June},}

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={14-22},   abstract={Energy consumption is becoming the Achilles' heel of the mobile user quality of experience partly due to undisciplined use of the cellular (3G) transmissions by applications. The operator infrastructure is typically configured for peak performance, whereas during periods of underutilisation the handsets pay the price by staying in high energy states even if each application only uses a fraction of the maximum available bandwidth. In this paper we promote a bi-radio scenario where instead of independently using own cellular connections, several users share a single cellular link offered by one member of a coalition (a rotating aggregator). We present Watts2Share, an architecture for energy-aware traffic consolidation whereby group members' data flows transmitted through a second radio (e.g., WiFi) are aggregated by the aggregator and retransmitted through the cellular link. Through careful and repeatable studies we demonstrate that this scheme saves up to 68% of the total transmission energy in handsets compared to a pure 3G scenario. The studies are based on a wide range of real traffic traces and real cellular operator settings, and further illustrate that this scheme reduces the overall energy by reducing the signalling overhead, as well as extending the lifetime of all handsets.},   keywords={3G mobile communication;cellular radio;energy consumption;mobile handsets;quality of experience;wireless LAN;Watts2Share;energy-aware traffic consolidation;energy consumption;mobile user quality of experience;cellular transmissions;bi-radio scenario;cellular connections;cellular link;WiFi;handset lifetime;Energy consumption;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Bandwidth;Downlink;Smart phones;traffic consolidation;bandwidth sharing;3G;WiFi;SoftAP},   doi={10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.29},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={5581-5583},   abstract={The rapid growth in global sensor networks is leading to an explosion in the volume, velocity and variety of geospatial and geoscientific data. This coupled with the increasing integration of geospatial data into our everyday lives is also driving an increasing expectation of spatial information on-demand, and with minimal delay. The challenge we face in meeting these expectations is how to convert the vast and increasing volume of data being delivered from an increasingly diverse network of sensor things into meaningful information in a timely fashion. A key factor in meeting these challenges is the development and implementation of international standards (through the Open Geospatial Consortium [OGC®] and other international standards bodies) focused on establishing common methods and protocols that enable machine-to-machine transfer of data from sensors to people via the internet. However, until recently there has been a gap in the standardization of the spatial data architectures and technologies used to manage the geospatial data at the server-side and this has led to numerous ad-hoc and bespoke spatial data infrastructures being constructed which are potentially incompatible with each other and the wider ecosystem of the Internet of Things. Over the past 3 years the OGC has been working at filling this gap through the development the first international standard for Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), with this new standard expected to be published in 2017. DGGS are a form of Earth reference system that represents the Earth using a hierarchical equal-area tessellation of the surface of the Earth and are designed to ensure a repeatable representation of measurements that is better suited to today's requirements and technologies. A DGGS presents a common framework that is capable of linking very large multi-resolution and multi-domain datasets together to enable the next generation of analytic processes to be applied. To date, DGGS haven't been used directly in the context of sensor networks. This paper proposes to demonstrate the application of DGGS to the Internet of Things and to highlight the immense benefit and value of using standards to enable interoperability in the era of Big Data.},   keywords={Big Data;data analysis;data visualisation;geographic information systems;geophysics computing;grid computing;Internet;Internet of Things;open systems;discrete global grid systems;global sensor networks;geospatial data;geoscientific data;spatial information on-demand;sensor things;international standards bodies;protocols;standardization;spatial data architectures;DGGS;Earth reference system;Big Data;Open Geospatial Consortium;OGC®;interoperability;Internet of Things;Standards;Earth;Geospatial analysis;Spatial databases;Face;Discrete Global Grid System;Digital Earth Reference Model;OGC;Internet of Things;Sensor Networks;Spatial Data Integration},   doi={10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128269},   ISSN={2153-7003},   month={July},}

It can be used for familiarizing researchers with the vast scope of research possible in this application domain. The smart city is primarily a concept, and there is still not a clear and consistent definition among practitioners and academia. As a simplistic explanation, a smart city is a place where traditional networks and services are made more flexible, efficient, and sustainable with the use of information, digital, and telecommunication technologies to improve the city's operations for the benefit of its inhabitants. Smart cities are greener, safer, faster, and friendlier. The different components of a smart city include smart infrastructure, smart transportation, smart energy, smart health care, and smart technology. These components are what make the cities smart and efficient. Information and communication technology (ICT) are enabling keys for transforming traditional cities into smart cities. Two closely related emerging technology frameworks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data (BD), make smart cities efficient and responsive. The technology has matured enough to allow smart cities to emerge. However, there is much needed in terms of physical infrastructure, a smart city, the digital technologies translate into better public services for inhabitants and better use of resources while reducing environmental impacts. One of the formal definitions of the smart city is the following: a city "connecting the physical infrastructure, the information-technology infrastructure, the social infrastructure, and the business infrastructure to leverage the collective intelligence of the city". Another formal and comprehensive definition is "a smart sustainable city is an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operations and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects". Any combination of various smart components can make cities smart. A city need not have all the components to be labeled as smart.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={87-92},   abstract={Hardware security-based threats are often ignored or poorly considered by embedded system developers who focus on their system's functional specifications. Most embedded systems utilize software-based security mechanisms such as right management or cryptography, nevertheless they can be easily defeated by hardware attacks if no specific care is given during the development of the software. Consequently, it is necessary to provide software developers with efficient tools to assist in designing robust embedded systems against hardware security threats. In this work, we focus on medical embedded systems including a microcontroller unit (MCU) running the main application. We firstly show that the software running on the MCU is vulnerable against hardware attacks; then, we present an evaluation platform dedicated to MCU-based design to evaluate and secure software early in the design phase. We finally present preliminary results obtained with this platform, considering the side channel resilience of modern MCUs.},   keywords={Hardware;Software;Cryptography;Tools;Medical services;Safety;Hardware security;Internet of Things (IoT);embedded security;Hardware attacks;power supply glitch attack},   doi={10.1109/IVSW.2018.8494843},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) is one of the hemodynamic instabilities with high mortality rate that is frequent among many groups of patients. This study presented a methodology to predict AHE for ICU patients based on big data time series. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was used to calculate patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) time series and some features, which are bandwidth of the amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and power of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) were extracted. Then, the Genetic Programming (GP) is used to build the classification model for detection of AHE.

The IoT devices are usually wirelessly networked, and they serve as a key enabling technology for many critical smart city applications, such as intelligent transportation, smart grid, smart building, and mobile healthcare. However, security has become a key challenge for the wide deployment of IoT: because of the environmental influences, the IoT data are inherently noisy. Moreover, the IoT devices may be compromised by attackers to intentionally generate fake data. Finally, the underlying wireless network can also be subverted. To address the security issue in IoT, we propose a policy-based secure and trustworthy sensing scheme for IoT named RealAlert, in which the trustworthiness of both data and the IoT devices are evaluated based on both the reporting history and the context in which the data are collected using policy rules. Experimental results have shown that the RealAlert scheme can accurately assess the trust of the sensor nodes as well as data in IoT.},   keywords={Internet of Things;security of data;smart cities;wireless channels;IoT devices;trustworthy sensing scheme;critical smart city applications;smart grid;smart building;IoT data;wireless network;policy-based secure sensing;Internet of Things;smart object network;intelligent transportation;mobile healthcare;fake data generation;RealAlert scheme;Security;Smart cities;Internet of Things;Sensors;Smart grids;Data collection;Context;Internet of Things (IoT);policy;security;smart city;trust},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2720635},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={April},}

Activity monitoring is one of the most important services in the field of the elderly care service. In this paper, we proposed a wearable solution to provide an activity monitoring service on elders for caregivers. The system uses wireless signals to estimate calorie burned by the walking and localization. In addition, it also uses wireless motion sensors to recognize physical activity, such as drinking and restroom activity. Overall, the system can be divided into four parts: wearable device, gateway, cloud server, and caregiver's android application. The algorithms we proposed for drinking activity are Decision Tree (J48) and Random Forest (RF). While for restroom activity, we proposed supervised Reduced Error Pruning (REP) Tree and Variable Order Hidden Markov Model (VOHMM).

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-7},   abstract={Reliable wireless communication even in adverse conditions is the key for building the energy efficient and dependable Internet of Things. In this paper, we explore the benefits of channel diversity for enabling efficient wireless communication: we propose MRR (Multi-channel Round-Robin), a backward-compatible evolution of beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15.4 in which energy constrained nodes take advantage of additional active periods operating on different channels in a round-robin way. Each active period starts with a beacon sent on a cyclically changing channel, which then allows an associated device to transmit data on the channel used for the beacon. MRR schedules the additional active periods at carefully selected instants to avoid direct beacon collisions. To motivate our work, we first experimentally corroborate previous findings that channel diversity is an effective way of mitigating variable or poor transmission conditions. Then, we observe that channel diversity improves the quality of transmission even better than expected - it appears that wireless sensor nodes have a radiation pattern that changes significantly from one frequency channel to another, which often results in a considerably improved gain when using the right communication channel. The evaluation of the MRR scheme through measurements on a real indoor multihop testbed shows that the proposed scheme results in significantly improved Packet Reception Ratio even without resorting to e.g. channel blacklisting. These results confirm the benefits of multichannel operation and exhibit a fully functional solution that does not add a large overhead compared to using a single channel.},   keywords={diversity reception;indoor radio;Internet of Things;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication scheduling;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks;beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15.4;round-robin channel diversity;wireless communication;Internet of Things;multichannel round-robin;MRR schedules;wireless sensor nodes;radiation pattern;communication channel;indoor multihop testbed;packet reception ratio;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Antenna radiation patterns;Receiving antennas;Mobile communication;Wireless communication;Wireless Sensor Networks;multi-channel;beacon-enabled 802.15.4;IPv6;auto-configuration},   doi={10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794840},   ISSN={2166-9589},   month={Sept},}

To evaluate the performance of a flexible solar panel under skin, ex-vivo experiments are conducted under natural sunlight and artificial light sources. The results show that the solar panel covered by a 3 mm thick porcine flap can output tens of microWatts to a few milliWatts depending on the light conditions. The subcutaneous solar energy harvester is tested on different body parts, which suggests the optimal position for the harvester to implant is between neck and shoulder. A wireless implantable system powered by the subcutaneous energy harvester is presented, which consists of a power management circuit, a temperature sensor, and a Bluetooth low energy module. An application is developed for data visualization on mobile devices, which can be a gateway for future IoT-based healthcare applications. The entire device is embedded in a transparent silicone housing (38 mm × 32 mm × 4 mm), including a 7 mAh rechargeable battery for energy storage. The average power consumption of the implants is about 30 μW in a 10 min operation cycle. With the subcutaneous solar energy harvester, the self-powered operation of the implantable sensor prototype is demonstrated by long-term experimental results.

The aim of this paper is to provide a novel recommendation engine for personalized advised wearables and IoT solutions for any given individual. The way the engine works is through first identifying the diseases that this person is at risk of, given his/her attributes and medical history. This is done via analyzing the individual's unstructured medical history using text mining, adding it to his/her structured demographic attributes, and then feeding this data to a machine learning classification model that predicts eventual diseases. Then, we map these diseases to the attributes that need to be measured in order to monitor them.

 title={Hot topic session 4A: Reliability analysis of complex digital systems}, 
  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Today, there are several trends that are making the reliability analysis of complex integrated circuits an important challenge in industry. As transistor geometries shrink, the number of physical failure mechanisms is increasing while at the same time the number of transistors per chip is still growing. The rollout of new services is pushing compute demands both in handheld devices and in the data center which is driving up complexity and the level of integration. People are becoming critically dependent on mobile services and expect high availability. Looking forward to the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) where processors and routers will be embedded in billions of end-points, we are only going to see an increased demand for reliable computing. In this session, we bring together three different industrial perspectives on reliability. The first looks at the end-points, the second looks at the servers and the last looks at the economic drivers for reliability and the demand for new EDA tools for reliability analysis. In the first talk, Rob Aitken from ARM will discuss the reliability challenges in mobile applications. As mobile systems continue to increase in size and complexity, and user requirements are also becoming more stringent, it is important for designers of mobile systems to be aware of reliability issues, and to adapt their methodologies accordingly. This talk discusses the issues involved, from latent defects, through soft errors, aging and wearout, and shows how to consider these as part of the design process, how to quantify their effects, and how to mitigate them through design changes. In the second presentation, Burcin Aktan from Intel is going to discuss the evolution of the reliability features that are found in server applications. With so many processing units packed in data centers the reliability requirements on an individual device is growing, especially with integrated memory controllers and very high bandwidth data pathways. What was an “add-on” to a device function, 10–15 years ago, now needs to be considered carefully with stringent budgets distributed to each functional block that contribute to overall error rates. This talk will focus on the evolution of reliability features in a number of server products leading into the current state and look at how today's designers are dealing with the challenges of gathering requirements, translating these to design implementation and delivering quality features to customers. Finally we will close with remarks on future directions and possible research areas. In the final presentation, Olivier Lauzeral from iROC Technologies will discuss the importance of methodologies for the reliability analysis of complex SoCs. There is an inherent cost to adding reliability features in a complex IC and designers need to be able to make informed decisions about how much hardware to allocate for mitigation (redundancy, error correction, repair). A prerequisite to make such choices is clearly defined targets and this requires an economic framework where the cost of failures is understood. Once the reliability targets for a system and individual devices are established, there is a need for EDA tools which allow designers to compute the failure rate and failure modes within the device. This analysis must include all failure mechanisms (radiation effects, lifetime effects, manufacturing detects) and take into account the relevant de-ratings between faults and observed errors. This new EDA infra-structure is key for designers to make effective trade-offs in order to arrive at a cost effective design.},   keywords={Mobile communication;Integrated circuit reliability;Servers;Reliability engineering;Integrated circuit modeling},   doi={10.1109/VTS.2013.6548898},   ISSN={1093-0167},   month={April},}

Moreover, with the help of software defined networking (SDN) paradigm, it can enhance the user experience. To achieve personal health information sharing and the access control among parities, a similar symptoms matching process should be executed before that. However, the matching process requires users to exchange symptoms information, conflicting with the ever-increasing privacy concerns on protecting private symptoms from strangers. To realize privacy-preserving symptoms matching, in this paper, we design two blind signature-based symptom matching schemes in SDN-based MHSNs, which can achieve the coarse-grained symptom matching and fine-grained symptom matching, respectively. Moreover, our schemes do not relay on any trusted third party. Security analysis and detailed simulations show that our proposed schemes can realize efficient privacy-preserving symptom matching. Finally, we do comprehensive experimental evaluation on real-world smartphones to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed schemes.},   keywords={biomedical communication;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;mobile computing;smart phones;social networking (online);software defined networking;symptom matching schemes;SDN;MHSNs;coarse-grained symptom matching;fine-grained symptom matching;mobile healthcare social networks;software defined networking paradigm;user experience;personal health information sharing;similar symptoms matching process;symptoms information;privacy concerns;private symptoms;healthcare system;privacy-preserving symptom matching;access control;Medical services;Privacy;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Social network services;Smart phones;Internet of Things;Blind signature;coarse/fine-grained;mobile healthcare social networks (MHSNs);symptoms matching},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2799209},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

It is expected that the emerging healthcare technology will change the way healthcare is delivered in both rural and urban settings of the developing world by building upon this technology to leapfrog from poorly prepared to medically equipped environments capable of tackling some of the most challenging medical issues of the developing world such as patients' vital signs capture, patient prioritization and preparedness to virus outbreaks such as Ebola.

These cyber-physical systems (CPSs) not only lead to the accumulation of large amounts of data that can be used to build comprehensive mathematical models, but also raise the quest for real-time analysis and control in diverse application domains, such as environment, healthcare, avionics, smart interconnected automobiles, and smart buildings. Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules. In addition, the prohibitive nature of power consumption, data movement, and memory bandwidth issues calls for a shift of processing the decision-making strategies from within large supercomputing centers closer to the actual sensing site via many distributed networks-on-chip (NoCs)-based multicore platforms. Toward this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient NoC-based multicore architecture capable of solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems. By carefully analyzing the spatiotemporal workload characteristics of the NMPC problems, we propose the design of an efficient NoC architecture.

Hence, readings from individual nodes may reach their destination by exploiting both local and long-range transmission capabilities. The compressed sensing (CS) paradigm may help finding a convenient mix of the two options, especially if it follows the rakeness-based design flow that has been recently introduced. CS is exploited by identifying local hubs that aggregate many sensor readings in a smaller number of quantities that are then transmitted to the central collector. We here show that, depending on the relative cost of local versus long-range transmission, carefully administering the choice of the hubs, the breadth of the neighborhood from which they collect readings, as well as the coefficients with which those readings a linearly aggregated, one may significantly reduce the energy needed to sample the field. Simulations indicate that savings may be over 50% for values of the parameters modeling nowadays local and long-range transmission technologies.},   keywords={compressed sensing;Internet;Internet of Things;hub spreading;common distributed sensing scenarios;local wireless sensor networks;central collector;compressed sensing paradigm;CS;rakeness-based design flow;long-range transmission technologies;IoT;rakeness-based compressed sensing;short-long-range communication;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Protocols;Data aggregation;Internet of Things;Compressed sensing;Electronic mail;Compressed sensing (CS);Internet of Things;rakeness;signals on graphs;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2828647},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

One of the established applications of WSN is localization of moving objects, which is integral part of monitoring, surveillance, intrusion detection and target tracking. For localizing a moving object in WSNs, generally, a set of location-aware static WSN nodes are used to localize the mobile nodes or moving target using a specific localization algorithm. RSSI and Trilateration based location identification is a well-known traditional method which needs distance calculation prior to localization. Many researchers have modified the traditional trilateration method to better suit their application or in general. In this paper we present, a modified trilateration method, which uses our application specific cooperative technique with better choice of beacon node placement to improve distance calculation method. The distance values are then used to expedite the trilateration process. The proposed technique has been simulated and compared with the traditional method.

However, security concerns should not be overlooked since an adversary could exploit the vulnerabilities in the design of some secure protocols. To this aim, in this paper we focus in particular on broadcast authentication in resource constrained devices. This security service is still in its infancy when devices are deployed in unattended environments.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={99-106},   abstract={In the world of "Internet of Things" (IoT), millions of interconnected smart devices have to share information in a fast and secure way. In order to ensure the success and widespread adoption of IoT applications, cryptographic services must be provided to ensure secure communications and avoid skepticism about new emerging technologies. Due to its short key sizes, elliptic curve cryptography is typically deployed on resource-constrained devices in order to enable public-key cryptographic services, i.e. secure key exchanges between smart devices. In the past few years, there has been a growing interest in Curve25519 due to its elegant design aimed at both high-security and high-performance, making it one of the most promising candidates to secure IoT applications. In fact, beside providing appropriate security levels, most IoT applications must adhere to strict latency requirements and provide guarantee to process information in a tiny fraction of time. Until now Curve25519 hardware implementations were mainly optimized for high-throughput applications, while no special care was given to low-latency designs. In this work, we close this gap and provide a Curve25519 hardware design targeting low-latency applications. Our implementation takes only 13,639 cycles for a variable-base Curve25519 scalar multiplication and can be operated up to 115 MHz on Xilinx Zynq 7030 FPGA devices. This allows to compute a session key in less than 120 μs, which outperforms known FPGA-based Curve25519 implementations by a factor of 2.8, yet requiring 24 % less area resources.},   keywords={field programmable gate arrays;public key cryptography;X25519 hardware implementation;low-latency applications;Internet of Things;IoT;interconnected smart devices;information sharing;secure communications;elliptic curve cryptography;resource-constrained devices;public-key cryptographic services;secure key exchanges;Curve25519 hardware design;variable-base Curve25519 scalar multiplication;Xilinx Zynq 7030 FPGA devices;session key;field programmable gate array;ECC;Curve25519;FPGA;Zynq;ECDH;X25519},   doi={10.1109/DSD.2016.65},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={466-469},   abstract={Diabetic ulcers represent a significant health issue. Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on Red-Yellow-Black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.},   keywords={cameras;diseases;medical image processing;mobile computing;smart phones;flexible wound assessment system;diabetic patient;Android smartphone;diabetic ulcers;wound assessment;visual examination;wound size;healing status;caregivers;high-resolution digital camera;chronic ulcer image analysis;wound image analysis system;Android App;accelerated mean-shift algorithm;skin color;red-yellow-black color evaluation model;Wounds;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Diabetes;Algorithm design and analysis;Smart phones;Patients with diabetes;Android Smartphones;Android App;RGB color evaluation;Mean Shift Algorithm},   doi={10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380509},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

We present an IoT based smart edge system for remote health monitoring, in which wearable vital sensors transmit data into two novel software engines, namely Rapid Active Summarization for effective PROgnosis (RASPRO) and Criticality Measure Index (CMI) alerts, both of which we have implemented in the IoT smart edge. RASPRO transforms voluminous sensor data into clinically meaningful summaries called Personalized Health Motifs (PHMs). The CMI alerts engine computes an aggregate criticality score. Our IoT smart edge employs a risk-stratified protocol consisting of rapid guaranteed push of alerts &amp; PHMs directly to the physicians, and best effort pull of detailed data-on-demand (DD-on-D) through the cloud. We have carried out both clinical validation and performance evaluation of our smart edge system. The clinical validation on 183 patients demonstrated that the IoT smart edge is highly effective in remote monitoring, advance warning and detection of cardiac conditions, as quantified by three measures, precision (0.87), recall (0.83), and F1-score (0.85). Furthermore, performance evaluation showed significant reductions in the bandwidth (98%) and energy (90%), thereby making it suitable for emerging narrow-band IoT networks. In the deployment of our system in the cardiology institute of our University hospital, we observed that our IoT smart edge helped to increase the availability of physicians by 59%.

However, these scenarios will critically rely on the large-scale deployed sensors that constantly transmit streaming data to cloud platform for real-time estimation, which brings the issue of privacy disclosure since smart devices will gather kinds of data including personal sensitive information. Meanwhile, there is not some universal method to solve privacy problem in 5G because of diversified security needs for different applications. In this paper, an unscented Kalman filter based differentially private steaming data share scheme is proposed to protect user privacy for cloud platform in IoT.

Communication between these devices and the Internet is facilitated with the help of IoT gateways. To have maximum coverage of network with reduced overall deployment cost, optimal placement of gateways is necessary. Owing to the high cost involved with IoT gateways, devices known as Solution Specific Gateways can be utilized along with IoT gateways for cost-effective gateway placement. In this paper, we propose a Network Intersection based Candidate Gateway Location Selection algorithm called NewIoTGateway-Select which determines the minimum number of gateways to be placed in a given Smart City scenario. NewIoTGateway-Select algorithm computes the candidate locations for gateway placement and selects optimal locations from them, in polynomial time.

There is a need for IoT-based remote health monitoring systems that take care of the health of elderly people without compromising their convenience and preference of staying at home. However, such systems may generate large amounts of data. The key research challenge addressed in this paper is to efficiently transmit healthcare data within the limit of the existing network infrastructure, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we identified the key network requirements of a typical remote health monitoring system in terms of real-time event update, bandwidth requirements and data generation. Furthermore, we studied the network communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP to understand the needs of such a system, in particular the bandwidth requirements and the volume of generated data. Subsequently, we have proposed IReHMo - an IoT-based remote health monitoring architecture that efficiently delivers healthcare data to the servers. The CoAP-based IReHMo implementation helps to reduce up to 90% volume of generated data for a single sensor event and up to 56% required bandwidth for a healthcare scenario.

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-11},   abstract={An ultra-low power electrocardiogram (ECG) processing architecture with an adequate level of accuracy is a necessity for Internet of Things (IoT) medical wearable devices. This paper presents a novel real-time QRS detector and an ECG compression architecture for IoT healthcare devices. An absolute-value curve length transform (A-CLT) is proposed that effectively enhances the QRS complex detection with minimized hardware resources. The proposed architecture requires adders, shifters, and comparators only, and removes the need for any multipliers. QRS detection was accomplished by using adaptive thresholds in the A-CLT transformed ECG signal, and achieved a sensitivity of 99.37% and the predictivity of 99.38% when validated using Physionet ECG database. Furthermore, a lossless compression technique was incorporated into the proposed architecture that uses the ECG signal first derivative and entropy encoding. An average compression ratio of 2.05 was achieved when evaluated using MIT-BIH database. The proposed QRS detection architecture deals with almost all the ECG signal artifacts, such as low-frequency noise, baseline drift, and high-frequency interference with minimum hardware resources. The proposed QRS architecture was synthesized using 65-nm low-power process using standard-cell-based flow. The power consumption of the design was 6.5 nW while operating at a supply of 1 V and a frequency of 250 Hz.

For every inanimate object can tell us something by the sound it makes, acoustic sensor demonstrates great advantages comparing to conventional electronic and mechanic sensors in such cases: overcoming environmental obstacles, mapping to existing use cases of detecting problems with human ears, low cost for deployment, etc. It could be widely applied to various domains, such as predictive maintenance of machinery, robot sensory, elderly and baby care in smart home, etc. Whether we can use the acoustic sensor data to understand what is happening and to predict what will happen relies heavily on the analytics capabilities we apply to the acoustic data, which has to overcome the obstacles of noise, disturbance and errors, and has to meet the requirement of real-time processing of high volume signals with large number of sensors. In this paper, we propose a scalable cognitive acoustics analytics service for IoT that provides the user an incremental learning approach to evolve their analytics capability on non-intuitive and unstructured acoustic data through the combination of acoustic signal processing and machine learning technology. It first performs acoustic signal processing and denoising, enables acoustic signal based abnormal detection based on sound intensity, spectral centroid, etc. Then based on the accumulated abnormal data, a supervised learning method is performed as baseline and a neural network based classifier is used to recognize acoustic events in different scenarios with various volume of sample data and requirement of accuracy. In addition, acoustic sensor arrays processing is supported for localization of moving acoustic source in more complex scenario. In this paper, we designed a hybrid computing structure. Finally, we conduct experiments on acoustic event recognition for machinery diagnosis, and show that the proposed system can achieve high accuracy.},   keywords={acoustic signal processing;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;signal denoising;cognitive acoustic analytics service;Internet of Things;IoT;electronic sensors;mechanic sensors;environmental obstacles;acoustic sensor data;acoustic signal processing;machine learning;acoustic signal denoising;supervised learning;neural network based classifier;Acoustics;Acoustic sensors;Speech recognition;Robot sensing systems;Internet of Things;Acoustic signal processing;acoustic analytics;internet of things;machine learning;acoustic signal processing},   doi={10.1109/IEEE.ICCC.2017.20},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

However, the structure of many RF features (such as signal sparsity) enables the use of compressive sensing (CS) techniques that acquire such signals at sub-Nyquist rates; while such CS-based analog-to-information (A2I) converters have the potential to enable low-cost and energy-efficient wideband RF sensing, they suffer from a variety of real-world limitations, such as noise folding, low sensitivity, aliasing, and limited flexibility. This paper proposes a novel CS-based A2I architecture called non-uniform wavelet sampling. Our solution extracts a carefully-selected subset of wavelet coefficients directly in the RF domain, which mitigates the main issues of existing A2I converter architectures. For multi-band RF signals, we propose a specialized variant called non-uniform wavelet bandpass sampling (NUWBS), which further improves sensitivity and reduces hardware complexity by leveraging the multi-band signal structure. We use simulations to demonstrate that NUWBS approaches the theoretical performance limits of $\ell_{1}$ -norm-based sparse signal recovery. We investigate hardware-design aspects and show ASIC measurement results for the wavelet generation stage, which highlight the efficacy of NUWBS for a broad range of RF feature extraction tasks in cost- and power-limited applications.},   keywords={compressed sensing;signal reconstruction;signal sampling;wavelet transforms;wavelet generation stage;sparse signal recovery;multiband signal structure;NUWBS;nonuniform wavelet bandpass sampling;multiband RF signals;A2I converter architectures;wavelet coefficients;energy-efficient wideband RF sensing;sub-Nyquist rates;compressive sensing techniques;signal sparsity;RF features;analog-to-digital converters;wideband RF feature extraction;Internet of Things;parameter tuning;cognitive abilities;RF transceivers;wideband radio-frequency signals;direction-of-arrival;spectral occupancy;analog-to-information conversion;nonuniform wavelet sampling;Radio frequency;Feature extraction;Wideband;Sensors;RF signals;Hardware;Analog-to-information (A2I) conversion;cognitive radio;compressive sensing;Internet of Things (IoT);radio-frequency (RF) signal acquisition;wavelets;spectrum sensing},   doi={10.1109/TCSI.2017.2729779},   ISSN={1549-8328},   month={Feb},}

The concept of smart city can be observed in every field of life including smart parking, banking, sewerage, waste management, smart transport, environmental monitoring and healthcare centers. Internet of things (IoT) is an implementation of smart nodes that sense the data, interpret, process and give response within a required time in a network. The ability to embed sensing devices into real environment enables the transformation of smart environment. However, there is a very little practical use of IoT infrastructure in real life. Many traditional approaches are proposed by researchers that do not address this issue correctly. We have focused on the smart sewerage system of a smart city in this paper. The sewerage system is represented by a graph in which a junction is assumed as a node and flow of water is represented as a directed edge in the graph theory. The flow of water is controlled by defining a safe path from one junction to another by predicting behavior of water and safe state of the system. The graph based model is transformed into a formal model using Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL). The proof of correctness is provided by using various facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox.},   keywords={graph theory;Internet of Things;sanitary engineering;smart cities;specification languages;Vienna development method;smart nodes;smart environment;smart sewerage system;smart city;graph based model;smart places;Internet of Things;Vienna Development Method-Specification Language;VDM-SL toolbox;Junctions;Smart cities;Sensors;Energy management;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Smart city;Internet of things (IoT);Sewerage system;Formal methods;Validation and verification},   doi={10.1109/FIT.2017.00016},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={45-50},   abstract={The interaction between devices sharing the same frequency domain, but using different communication protocols, is an important issue prevalent to the Internet of Things (IoT). IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4, protocols that overlap in applications such as home automation, health care and factory automation, is one such example. In these situations 802.11 networks are known to detrimentally interfere with 802.15.4 networks, degrading performance significantly. We show that the response to unsuccessful Clear Channel Assessments (CCA) is a large contributor to this degradation. Current responses do not distinguish between different transmission sources, employing the same response independent of the interferer type. However, as we show in this paper, it is beneficial to discriminate interferer types when performing CCA as this allows us to employ different strategies in handling occupied media. Our work considers in particular the low-power Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols based on the 802.15.4 standard. In such protocols, CCA is applied at the transmitter to arbitrate channel access, and also at the receiver for power efficient transmission detection. We present a protocol building block called Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment (DCCA) which allows us to tailor the reaction to a busy channel depending on the nature of the interfering network type. We evaluate an implementation of DCCA for the ContikiMAC protocol on the Maxfor MTM-CM5000MSP platform. The experimental evaluation shows that DCCA improves throughput of 802.15.4 networks in the presence of 802.11 networks significantly, ten-fold in some settings.},   keywords={access protocols;Internet of Things;radio receivers;radio transmitters;radiofrequency interference;wireless channels;wireless LAN;Zigbee;differentiating clear channel assessment;frequency domain;communication protocols;Internet of Things;IoT;IEEE 802.11 networks;IEEE 802.15.4, networks;CCA;low-power medium access control;ContikiMAC protocol;transmitter;receiver;power efficient transmission detection;protocol building block;interfering network;Maxfor MTM- CM5000MSP platform;DCCA;Interference;IEEE 802.15 Standards;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Receivers;Media Access Protocol;Transceivers;Wireless Sensor Networks;WiFi;802.15.4;CCA},   doi={10.1109/WiMOB.2014.6962148},   ISSN={2160-4886},   month={Oct},}

In this research, there are difficulties to apply the conventional key distribution approaches during interactions when considering both security and efficiency.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={20-25},   abstract={Cloud computing, arguably, has become the de facto computing platform for the big data processing by researchers and practitioners for the last decade, and enabled different stakeholders to discover valuable information from large scale data. At the same time, in the decade, we have witnessed the fast growing deployment of billions of sensors and actuators in multiple applications domains, such as transportation, manufacturing, connected/wearable health care, smart city and so on, stimulating the emerging of Edge Computing (a.k.a., fog computing, cloudlet). However, data, as the core of both cloud computing and edge computing, is still owned by each stakeholder and rarely shared due to privacy concern and formidable cost of data transportation, which significantly limits Internet of Things (IoT) applications that need data input from multiple stakeholders (e.g., video analytics collects data from cameras owned by police department, transportation department, retailer stores, etc.). In this paper, we envision that in the era of IoT the demand of distributed big data sharing and processing applications will dramatically increase since the data producing and consuming are pushed to the edge of the network. Data processing in collaborative edge environment needs to fuse data owned by multiple stakeholders, while keeping the computation within stakeholders' data facilities. To attack this challenge, we propose a new computing paradigm, Firework, which is designed for big data processing in collaborative edge environment (CEE). Firework fuses geographically distributed data by creating virtual shared data views that are exposed to end users via predefined interfaces by data owners. The interfaces are provided in the form of a set of datasets and a set of functions, where the functions are privacy preserved and bound to the datasets. Firework targets to share data while ensuring data privacy and integrity for stakeholders. By pushing the data processing as close as to data sources, Firework also aims to avoid data movement from the edge of the network to the cloud and improve the response latency.},   keywords={Big Data;cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy;Internet of Things;distributed Big Data sharing;Firework;distributed Big Data processing;collaborative edge environment;cloud computing;multiple applications domains;actuators;sensors;edge computing;data transportation;Internet of Things;IoT;stakeholder data facility;CEE;geographic distributed data fusion;virtual shared data views;data privacy;data integrity;data sources},   doi={10.1109/HotWeb.2016.12},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

In this paper, we conduct a quantitative feasibility study of a Digital Health (D-Health) system that is aimed at acquiring and processing health data using the emerging Internet-of-Everything paradigm. We specifically investigate the technological feasibility of communication, software, and data privacy aspects.},   keywords={cloud computing;data analysis;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;patient care;patient diagnosis;security of data;Internet-of-Everything;IoE;digital health system;D-Health system;system security;diagnostic quality;patient health care;cloud computing;data analytics;data privacy;Medical services;Data privacy;Sensors;Monitoring;Wireless communication;Media Access Protocol;decision support;Internet of Everything (IoE);visualization;analytics;remote health monitoring},   doi={10.1109/ISCC.2016.7543821},   ISSN={},   month={June},}

The smart nature of these homes raises obvious security concerns and history has shown that a vulnerability in only one component may provide the means to compromise the system as a whole. Thus, the addition of every new component, and especially new components with external networking capability, increases risks that must be carefully considered. In this paper we examine one of the most active open source home automation framework, Open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) which is used as platform for many other IoT supported devices. First, we go through openHAB security architecture and supported features following the challenge of a static source code analysis of several most used openHAB packages (called bindings) and carefully crafted test cases that revealed many undocumented features of the platform. Next, we exploited security flaws by constructing two proof-of-concept attacks that: (1) openHAB system denial of service; (2) inject custom binding for message bus monitoring and control; We conclude the paper with security best practices for the design of custom openHAB bindings.},   keywords={home automation;Internet of Things;program diagnostics;public domain software;security of data;source code (software);system buses;security analysis;open home automation bus system;openHAB security architecture;smart homes;open source home automation framework;IoT supported devices;static source code analysis;openHAB packages;openHAB system denial of service;message bus monitoring;openHAB bindings;Security;Smart homes;Protocols;Runtime;Java;Computer bugs},   doi={10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973614},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2018},   volume={},   number={},   pages={176-183},   abstract={We have reached the point with Internet of Things (IoT) end-devices, when procedures of dismantling have to be discussed and put into practice. The first machine-to-machine (M2M) devices were those sensors and actuators that have been exchanging information over the Internet for over 10 years. The early M2M devices are now reaching their end of life, and we start experiencing the first challenges regarding their final termination. In the meantime, the IoT phenomena industrialized data collection, processing and presentation. The number of IoT devices keeps increasing, and their communication capabilities keep widening from year to year. Still, their lifecycle is neither defined nor managed well; and this is partially the reason why the number of abandoned zombie devices keeps increasing. Besides taking care of their bitter end, the beginning and middle of life phases have stages that needs attention - including the management of their deployment, configuration, and mobility, among other issues. The current paper introduces a generic IoT device lifecycle model, first of its kind. Furthermore, the paper defines ultrashort, short, medium and long term changes, depending on how long the given configuration (in space, in environment, in hardware or software setup) lasts. It is sensible to track these stages for both semi-static and dynamic operating scenarios in order to keep the overall status of the system of systems in a healthy state. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the model, we describe a typical device lifecycle scenario for data and device security through a real-life, cellular mobile networking example.},   keywords={cellular radio;Internet of Things;cellular mobile networks;machine-to-machine devices;generic IoT device lifecycle model;Internet of Things end-devices;Internet of Things;Security;Monitoring;Hardware;Software;Sensors;iot;lifecycle;m2m;cellular network},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2018.00033},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Majority of such applications or services are to ease human life and/or to setup efficient processes in automated environments. However, this convenience is coming up with new challenges related to data security and human privacy. The objects in IoT are resource constrained devices and cannot implement a fool-proof security framework. These end devices work like eyes and ears to interact with the physical world and collect data for analytics to make expedient decisions. The storage and analysis of the collected data is done remotely using cloud computing. The transfer of data from IoT to the computing clouds can introduce privacy issues and network delays. Some applications need a real-time decision and cannot tolerate the delays and jitters in the network. Here, edge computing or fog computing plays its role to settle down the mentioned issues by providing cloud-like facilities near the end devices. In this paper, we discuss IoT, fog computing, the relationship between IoT and fog computing, their security issues and solutions by different researchers. We summarize attack surface related to each layer of this paradigm which will help to propose new security solutions to escalate it acceptability among end users.

The existence of nosocomial infection prediction systems in healthcare environments can contribute to improving the quality of the healthcare institution. It also can reduce the costs of the treatment of the patients that acquire these infections. The analysis of the available information allows preventing these infections which can help to identify their future occurrence.

Good models were obtained, induced by the Data Mining (DM), K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index 0.14).

Therefore, managing the criticality of a specific component, application or service in such an environment, is of fundamental importance. In this respect, this paper discusses an approach to identify and model criticalities of healthcare IoT systems, as a first step to effectively manage them in system implementation and deployment. To do so, it explains the mixed-criticality characteristics of such systems, describing two principal use cases, that stem from the combination of novel technologies with classic health care practices, namely (a) a remote elderly monitoring platform, as well as (b) a smart ambulance system.

A first step towards protecting a MANET is to analyze the vulnerabilities of the routing protocol(s), managing the connectivity. Understanding how these routing protocols can be exploited by those with ill intent, countermeasures can be developed, readying MANETs for wider deployment and use. One routing protocol for MANETs, developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as a multicast routing protocol for efficient data dissemination, is denoted "Simplified Multicast Forwarding'' (SMF). This protocol is analyzed, and its vulnerabilities described, in this paper. SMF consists of two independent components: (i) duplicate packet detection and (ii) relay set selection, each of which presents its own set of vulnerabilities that an attacker may exploit to compromise network integrity. This paper explores vulnerabilities in each of these, with the aim of identifying attack vectors and thus enabling development of countermeasures.},   keywords={mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;vulnerability analysis;simple multicast forwarding protocol;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast routing protocol;data dissemination;Relays;Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;IP networks;Vectors;MANET;vulnerability;multicast routing},   doi={10.1109/iThings/CPSCom.2011.63},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

Continuous checking has been proven as inefficient in many cases, due to the low degrees of observability and controllability and to the limited life time of batteries. Even, on-line testing is often unable to report the presence of internal errors, which can remain latent during long times. In this paper, a proposal is presented for improving the on-line testability of the different type of nodes in a WSN, saving energy and tracking error from their origin.},   keywords={intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;protocols;wireless sensor networks;Wireless Sensor Networks;cyber-physical systems;health-care instruments;Internet of Things;smart sensors;permanent faults;human users;continuous checking;on-line testing;online testing;communication protocols;transient fault;system dependability;Wireless sensor networks;Testing;Transient analysis;Protocols;Temperature sensors;Proposals;Security;Sensor Networks;On-line Testing;Dependability},   doi={10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046218},   ISSN={1942-9401},   month={July},}

In the modern health care environment, the usage of IoT technologies brings convenience of physicians and patients, since they are applied to various medical areas (such as real-time monitoring, patient information management, and healthcare management). The body sensor network (BSN) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT developments in healthcare system, where a patient can be monitored using a collection of tiny-powered and lightweight wireless sensor nodes. However, the development of this new technology in healthcare applications without considering security makes patient privacy vulnerable. In this paper, at first, we highlight the major security requirements in BSN-based modern healthcare system.

Most IoT devices are becoming minimized and are battery-operated because of the mobility of these devices. Thus, reducing the execution time and energy consumption has become an important problem, as has the need to extend the battery life. In this paper, we propose a data migration methodology that transfers read-dominant data from SRAM to the flash memory with the aim of improving the performance of small-scale embedded systems. We trace the memory access in the hybrid memory and analyze the memory access patterns to separate the read-dominant data from among the read/write data. The read-dominant data are then relocated to the flash memory sector. These procedures enabled us to reduce the energy consumption for accessing the data in SRAM. Experiments showed that, compared with placing data in SRAM, the proposed methodology achieved an improvement in the execution time, energy consumption, and battery life.},   keywords={embedded systems;flash memories;Internet of Things;power aware computing;SRAM chips;storage management;battery life;energy effective data migration methodology;memory access awareness;IoT devices;healthcare device industries;energy consumption;read-dominant data;hybrid memory;memory access patterns;flash memory sector;Internet of Things technology;SRAM;embedded system;Flash memories;Benchmark testing;Random access memory;Embedded systems;Memory management;Batteries;Nonvolatile memory;Internet of Things;embedded system;hybrid memory;energy efficiency;battery life;data migration},   doi={10.1109/ECTI-NCON.2018.8378281},   ISSN={},   month={Feb},}

Prior missing tag identification protocols concentrated on identifying all of the tags. However, there may be some scenarios in which we just care about the key tags instead of all tags, making it inefficient to merely identify the missing key tags due to the interference of replies from the ordinary tags (i.e., nonkey tags). In this paper, we propose to investigate the problem of efficiently and completely identifying the missing key tags for anonymous RFID systems in which the tag privacy is required to be well protected. First, we propose a vector-based missing key tag identification protocol called VEKI. Then we propose an improved protocol called iVEKI, which consists of two phases: 1) ordinary tag deactivation and 2) missing key tag identification. The parameters of the proposed VEKI and iVEKI protocols are theoretically optimized to maximize the time efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed VEKI and iVEKI protocols and the simulation results illustrate that they outperform other existing protocols in terms of execution time.},   keywords={data privacy;protocols;radiofrequency identification;vectors;tag privacy;iVEKI protocols;anonymous RFID systems;radio frequency identification systems;missing items;nonkey tags;vector-based missing key tag identification protocol;execution time;ordinary tag deactivation;VEKI protocols;time efficiency;Radiofrequency identification;Protocols;Privacy;Servers;Electronic mail;Internet of Things;Cloning;Anonymous radio frequency identification (RFID) systems;efficiently and completely;missing key tag identification;parameter optimization},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2752239},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={Aug},}

Smartphones and other mobile devices can be transformed into effective nutrition tracking tools that consumers can easily make use of to help improve their lives and wellbeing. The academic community has conducted a vast amount of research in the area of mobile nutrition however a number of challenges still exist in the area of human-computer interaction (HCI). HCI has been found to be a key contributing factor when developing systems that constantly and directly interact with their respective users. Effective HCI is required to bridge the communication barrier between a user and the device, thus ensuring a seam-less approach. This research paper highlights the efforts done by academics in the area of mobile HCI within the nutrition landscape. Every study will be discussed in detailed by highlighted the key benefits together with a number of challenges that still exist. As a result, this review of literature will identify key lacunae that still exist in the field of mobile HCI within the nutrition landscape.},   keywords={health care;human computer interaction;mobile computing;smart phones;human-computer interaction patterns;mobile nutrition landscape;mobile computing;obesity;mobile health interventions;smartphones;mobile devices;nutrition tracking tools;mobile HCI;Mobile communication;Human computer interaction;Monitoring;Mobile handsets;Conferences;Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;human-computer interaction(HCI);mobile HCI;nutrition tracking;diet management},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2014.78},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

The role of security following the fact that a new type of devices known as wearables constitute an emerging area. This paper delivers an applicability study of the state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives for wearable IoT devices, including the pairing-based cryptography. Pairing-based schemes are well-recognized as fundamental enablers for many advanced cryptographic applications, such as privacy protection and identity-based encryption. To deliver a comprehensive view on the computational power of modern wearable devices (smart phones, watches, and embedded devices), we perform an evaluation of a variety of them utilizing bilinear pairing for real-time communication. In order to deliver a complete picture, the obtained bilinear pairing results are complemented with performance figures for classical cryptography (such as block ciphers, digital signatures, and hash functions). Our findings show that wearable devices of today have the needed potential to efficiently operate with cryptographic primitives in real time.

In such applications, objects can be efficiently managed by attaching them with low-cost RFID tags and carefully monitoring them. The missing objects, therefore, can be identified by the readers in the RFID system. Most of prior missing tag identification protocols consider the ideal scenario that all the tags' IDs are known to the reader, which ignore that some tags with unknown IDs, called unknown tags, may be present in the system. In this paper, we investigate the problem of efficiently identifying the missing tags with a predefined reliability for large-scale RFID systems with unknown tags. We first propose a basic efficient and reliable missing tag identification protocol called B-ERMI. Then we propose an enhanced protocol called E-ERMI to further improve the efficiency. The parameters of our proposed ERMI protocols are optimized to minimize the execution time. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed ERMI protocols and the simulation results illustrate that the ERMI protocols outperform other existing ones.},   keywords={protocols;radiofrequency identification;telecommunication network reliability;missing tag identification;large-scale RFID systems;radio frequency identification;Internet of Things;IoT;B-ERMI;E-ERMI;ERMI protocols;missing tag identification protocol;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification;Servers;Estimation;Reliability theory;Internet of Things;Efficient and reliable protocols;missing tag identification;radio frequency identification (RFID) systems;unknown tags},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2017.2664810},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={June},}

In many IoT applications (e.g., smart homes, healthcare, etc.), all the IoT devices should be synchronized in time. However, some malicious nodes located in the IoT network can influence the time synchronization, which may interrupt the IoT system and lead to serious accidents. Therefore, it is critical and challenging to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of time during the time synchronization among all the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme to assure the security during time synchronization in IoT. Specifically, a publicly verifiable ledger is utilized to record and broadcast time, which can minimize many attacks from external environments. The use of multiple time sources can avoid the vulnerabilities caused by the centralized generation of accurate time. Moreover, the decentralized structure of this scheme has the advantage of adapting the changes of network topology. By employing an improved Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism, time synchronization can be implemented efficiently. At last, the analysis results show that our proposed scheme can achieve the desired security with high efficiency.},   keywords={Synchronization;Protocols;Internet of Things;Robustness;Internet of Things;Time Synchronization;Blockchain;Security.},   doi={10.1109/JIOT.2018.2874222},   ISSN={2327-4662},   month={},}

The security and privacy is being breached when the mobile applications are mishandled or tampered by the hackers by performing reverse engineering on the application leading to catastrophic consequences. To combat against these vulnerabilities, there is need to create an awareness of the potential risks of these devices and effective strategies are needed to be implemented to achieve a level of security defense. In this paper, the benefits of healthcare IoT system and the possible vulnerabilities that may result are presented. Also, we propose to develop solutions against these vulnerabilities by protecting mobile applications using obfuscation and return oriented programming techniques.

  year={2018},   volume={26},   number={2},   pages={864-878},   abstract={Compound TCP will play a central role in future home WiFi networks supporting Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Compound TCP was designed to be fair but can manifest throughput unfairness in infrastructure-based IEEE 802.11 networks when devices at different locations experience different wireless channel quality. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive analytical model for compound TCP over WiFi. Our model captures the flow and congestion control dynamics of multiple competing long-lived compound TCP connections as well as the medium access control layer dynamics (i.e., contention, collisions, and retransmissions) that arise from different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) perceived by the devices. Our model provides accurate estimates for TCP packet loss probabilities and steady-state throughputs for IoT devices with different SNRs. More importantly, we propose a simple adaptive control algorithm to achieve better fairness without compromising the aggregate throughput of the system. The proposed real-time algorithm monitors the access point queue, drives the system dynamics to the desired operating point which mitigates the adverse impacts of SNR differences, and accommodates the sporadically transmitting IoT sensors in the system.},   keywords={adaptive control;Internet of Things;transport protocols;wireless channels;wireless LAN;Internet of Things applications;flow dynamics;SNRs;compound TCP modeling;home WiFi;home WiFi;signal-to-noise ratios;IoT devices;TCP packet loss probabilities;medium access control layer dynamics;compound TCP connections;comprehensive analytical model;Compounds;Wireless fidelity;Throughput;Wireless communication;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks;Analytical models;Internet of Things;compound TCP;fixed-point analysis;WiFi;throughput unfairness;adaptive control},   doi={10.1109/TNET.2018.2806352},   ISSN={1063-6692},   month={April},}

The call button of patient is batteryless and wireless. The positioning system is developed for this batteryless button. When the switch is pressed, a wireless telegram is sent to reference nodes that act like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This wireless message contains the module ID and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value. The reference nodes or beacons forward the information gathered from target node to a central receiver attached to a computer. A program is developed to read the incoming signals to the receiver module for processing. This program calculate the distance between target node (unknown location) and each reference node (known location), and then it determines the position of the call button which held by the patient. In parallel, nurses hold smart phones, and the position is determined via WiFi-Based Positioning System (WPS). Both systems are combined and linked to the nurse calling system.

It is the enabling technology for a plethora of applications touching various aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, wearables, surveillance, home automation, smart manufacturing, and intelligent automotive systems. Existing IoT architectures are highly centralized and heavily rely on a back-end core network for all decision-making processes. This may lead to inefficiencies in terms of latency, network traffic management, computational processing, and power consumption. In this paper, we advocate the empowerment of front-end IoT devices to support the back-end network in fulfilling end-user applications requirements mainly by means of improved connectivity and efficient network management. A novel conceptual framework is presented for a new generation of IoT devices that will enable multiple new features for both the IoT administrators as well as end users. Exploiting the recent emergence of software-defined architecture, these smart IoT devices will allow fast, reliable, and intelligent management of diverse IoT-based applications.

 title={SymCerts: Practical Symbolic Execution for Exposing Noncompliance in X.509 Certificate Validation Implementations}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={503-520},   abstract={The X.509 Public-Key Infrastructure has long been used in the SSL/TLS protocol to achieve authentication. A recent trend of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems employing small footprint SSL/TLS libraries for secure communication has further propelled its prominence. The security guarantees provided by X.509 hinge on the assumption that the underlying implementation rigorously scrutinizes X.509 certificate chains, and accepts only the valid ones. Noncompliant implementations of X.509 can potentially lead to attacks and/or interoperability issues. In the literature, black-box fuzzing has been used to find flaws in X.509 validation implementations, fuzzing, however, cannot guarantee coverage and thus severe flaws may remain undetected. To thoroughly analyze X.509 implementations in small footprint SSL/TLS libraries, this paper takes the complementary approach of using symbolic execution. We observe that symbolic execution, a technique proven to be effective in finding software implementation flaws, can also be leveraged to expose noncompliance in X.509 implementations. Directly applying an off-the-shelf symbolic execution engine on SSL/TLS libraries is, however, not practical due to the problem of path explosion. To this end, we propose the use of SymCerts, which are X.509 certificate chains carefully constructed with a mixture of symbolic and concrete values. Utilizing SymCerts and some domain-specific optimizations, we symbolically execute the certificate chain validation code of each library and extract path constraints describing its accepting and rejecting certificate universes. These path constraints help us identify missing checks in different libraries. For exposing subtle but intricate noncompliance with X.509 standard, we cross-validate the constraints extracted from different libraries to find further implementation flaws. Our analysis of 9 small footprint X.509 implementations has uncovered 48 instances of noncompliance. Findings and suggestions provided by us have already been incorporated by developers into newer versions of their libraries.},   keywords={message authentication;public key cryptography;transport protocols;SymCerts;symbolic execution;noncompliance;X.509 certificate validation;X.509 public-key infrastructure;SSL/TLS protocol;authentication;SSL/TLS libraries;X.509 certificate chains;domain-specific optimizations;certificate chain validation code;path constraints extraction;Libraries;Computer bugs;Authentication;Standards;Explosions;Protocols},   doi={10.1109/SP.2017.40},   ISSN={2375-1207},   month={May},}

To ensure that the user can employ the AI efficiently and conveniently, we realize a variety of LPWA technologies to safeguard the network layer. In addition, to balance the demand for heterogeneous IoT devices with the communication delay and energy consumption, we put forward the AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method, starting from the perspective of traffic control. The AI algorithm provides the smart control of wireless-communication technology, intelligent applications and services for the choice of different wireless-communication technologies. As an example, we consider the AIWAC emotion interaction system, build the Cognitive-LPWAN and test the proposed AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method.

However, the hierarchy structure of shared files has not been explored in CP-ABE. In this paper, an efficient file hierarchy attribute-based encryption scheme is proposed in cloud computing. The layered access structures are integrated into a single access structure, and then, the hierarchical files are encrypted with the integrated access structure. The ciphertext components related to attributes could be shared by the files. Therefore, both ciphertext storage and time cost of encryption are saved.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-6},   abstract={Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of variation in the time interval between consecutive heart beats. HRV analysis is highly sensitive for risks linked with Cardiovascular disease, Diabetic Mellitus, disease states associated with Autonomic Dysrhythmia such as Hypertension and a large array of chronic degenerative medical condition. Sensitivity of HRV towards various medical condition accounts for its increased usage by doctors as a diagnostic, prognostic tool and to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment offered. Often borderline hypertensive patients with and without history of a cardiac event are subjected to stroke as well as cardiac mortality at high risk. Monitoring of HRV parameters for such cases of high risk will prove useful in providing adequate medical care at needed times. In this paper, the authors propose a low-cost and easy to use Remote HRV Monitoring System based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for borderline Hypertensive patients. In the proposed system, HRV parameters are derived using Wireless Zigbee based pulse sensor. Arduino transmits patient data to server using MQTT protocol. The application server collects HRV data and plots graphs. In case of an emergency situation, the care taker and doctor are intimated through Short Message Service (SMS) for providing adequate medical help. While there are currently no HRV analysis systems that alerts at times of high risk for hypertensive patients along with the aid of a remote doctor, the proposed system aims at achieving the same. The proposed system combines the dual benefits of Zigbee and WiFi technology. By doing so, it successfully fulfils all the ideal traits of a remote health monitoring system in terms of low-cost, long range, security, promptness and easy-to-use that serves in saving lives.},   keywords={biomedical telemetry;cardiology;diseases;electronic messaging;file servers;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;protocols;telemedicine;wireless LAN;Zigbee;IoT-based remote HRV monitoring system;hypertensive patients;heart rate variability;HRV analysis;cardiovascular disease;diabetic mellitus;disease states;HRV parameters;Internet of Things technology;Wireless Zigbee-based pulse sensor;short message service;WiFi technology;Zigbee technology;MQTT protocol;Heart rate variability;Monitoring;Servers;ZigBee;Biomedical monitoring;Hypertension;Heart Rate Variability (HRV);Hypertension;Cardiovascular disease;Diabetic mellitus;Internet of Things (IoT);Zigbee;Transport Level Security (TLS);Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)},   doi={10.1109/ICCCSP.2017.7944086},   ISSN={},   month={Jan},}

 title={Analog Signal Compression and Multiplexing Techniques for Healthcare Internet of Things}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={398-406},   abstract={Scalability is a major issue for Internet of Things (IoT) as the total amount of traffic data collected and/or the number of sensors deployed grow. In some IoT applications such as healthcare, power consumption is also a key design factor for the IoT devices. In this paper, a multi-signal compression and encoding method based on Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) is proposed that works fully in the analog domain without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Compression is achieved by quantizing all the input signals but one. While saving power, this method can also reduce the number of devices by combining one or more sensing functionalities into a single device (called 'AJSCC device'). Apart from analog encoding, AJSCC devices communicate to an aggregator node (FPMM receiver) using a novel Frequency Position Modulation and Multiplexing (FPMM) technique. Such joint modulation and multiplexing technique presents three mayor advantages-it is robust to interference at particular frequency bands, it protects against eavesdropping, and it consumes low power due to a very low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) operating region at the receiver. Performance of the proposed multi-signal compression method and FPMM technique is evaluated via simulations in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Miss Detection Rate (MDR), respectively.},   keywords={biomedical communication;combined source-channel coding;data compression;frequency modulation;health care;Internet of Things;multiplexing;power consumption;radio receivers;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;Analog Signal compression;multiplexing technique;traffic data;IoT applications;power consumption;IoT devices;encoding method;Analog Joint Source Channel Coding;analog domain;AJSCC device;analog encoding;FPMM receiver;joint modulation;Signal-to-Noise Ratio operating region;multisignal compression method;FPMM technique;healthcare Internet of Things;IoT scalability;frequency position modulation and multiplexing technique;power saving;SNR operating region;miss detection rate;mean square error;Medical services;Sensors;Power demand;Channel coding;Frequency division multiplexing;Shannon Mapping;Analog Signal Compression;Healthcare;IoT;Low Power;Modulation;Multiplexing},   doi={10.1109/MASS.2017.62},   ISSN={2155-6814},   month={Oct},}

The interest in I-Health systems (IHS) originates initially from the need to extend health services out of the hospital and monitor patients over extensive periods of time. Intelligent IHS are integrated systems in contact with or near the body able to sense, process and communicate biomedical, biochemical and physical parameters. Current and emerging developments in wireless sensors communications integrated with developments in pervasive and android technologies will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. This editorial paper presents a snapshot of recent developments in these areas and addresses some of the challenges and future implementation issues from the I-Health perspective.

IIoT is used in a wide range of applications such as transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, and energy management in smart grids. Most of the solutions reported in the literature for secure communications are not suitable for the aforementioned applications due to the usage of traditional TCP/IP-based network infrastructure. So, to handle this challenge, in this paper, a software-defined network (SDN) enabled multi-attribute secure communication model for an IIoT environment is designed. The proposed scheme works in three phases: 1) an SDN-IIoT communication model is designed using a cuckoo-filter-based fast-forwarding scheme, 2) an attribute-based encryption scheme is presented for secure data communication, and 3) a peer entity authentication scheme using a third party authenticator, Kerberos , is also presented.

Solutions built on existing and emerging technologies such as Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine and data analytics can improve on or create services able to address these challenges. These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City.

Efficient clustering and proper cluster head (CH) selection schemes are required, in order to improve energy saving of sensor nodes. In this paper, dynamic CH selection method (DCHSM) is used where CHs are selected in two phases. This algorithm improves energy saving on large scale thus can be used for IoT applications. Initially, Voronoi diagram is used to divide the monitoring area in polygonal shaped clusters. Then, CH election is performed in two phases.

IoT networks are expected to integrate billions of small devices to the Internet enabling countless applications ranging from automation of cities to home based healthcare solutions for elderly and vulnerable population. Such wide range of application pose unique challenges such as the need for high reliability, ultra low power and low delay communications. In addition to these challenges, such Internet enabled small devices will have to be equipped with the necessary security suits to cope with security challenges posed by the Internet. Furthermore, these solutions have to address such unique challenges via a micro controller generally with a limited processing power and memory consuming as little energy as possible. This paper presents an extension to the secure bootstrapping mechanism of the newly introduced IETF 6TiSCH protocol where the authentication keys are distributed within the trusted nodes of the IoT network to enable an efficient authentication and bootstrapping process. Using a distributed approach, we aim to reduce the communication overhead of the standard IETF 6TiSCH authentication mechanism and improve energy efficiency of the network by keeping authentication tokens at the edge of the IoT network.},   keywords={computer network security;cryptographic protocols;Internet;Internet of Things;statistical analysis;IoT network;secure bootstrapping mechanism;reliability;IETF 6TiSCH protocol;distributed user authentication token mechanism;standard IETF 6TiSCH authentication key mechanism;Internet of Things;home based healthcare solutions;low power low delay communications;microcontroller;Authentication;Routing protocols;Internet of Things;Proposals},   doi={10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417689},   ISSN={2577-2465},   month={June},}

Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is an emerging category of IoT where the QoS is key to the functioning and performance of the network. In WBAN applications are very sensitive and need mechanisms to respect the requirement of their sensed data. IEEE 802.15.6 [2] - is a BAN management protocol that provides mechanisms for multiple accesses to shared medium - supported QoS-based channel access models. In this paper we focus on CSMA/CA and slotted Aloha algorithms. These two algorithms are compared in terms of delay performance and total drop throughout. The simulation results are clearly showing that under heavily-loaded network conditions both algorithms is under-performing with respect to various QoS parameters. Most importantly, our simulations have proven that CSMA/CA provides shorter end-to-end delay. This preliminary evaluation suggests that CSMA/CA is more suitable for BAN networks aiming to optimize the communication delay.},   keywords={access protocols;body area networks;carrier sense multiple access;health care;Internet of Things;quality of service;wireless channels;wireless LAN;communication delay;BAN networks;preliminary evaluation;QoS parameters;heavily-loaded network conditions;delay performance;Aloha algorithms;CSMA/CA;QoS-based channel access models;multiple accesses;BAN management protocol;sensed data;WBAN applications;Wireless Body Area Networks;health care providers;compile data;transmit data;consumers;connected devices;IoT;IEEE 802.15.6 channel access procedure;performance evaluation;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Quality of service;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Delays;Transmitters;Wireless sensor networks;WBAN;QoS;IoT},   doi={10.1109/FiCloud.2018.00031},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

Upon sensing the temperature and pulse rate, the data is to be sent to a cloud named “Thingspeak”. Here, a graph displays the sensed temperature and pulse rate. This data is then fetched on a mobile application. Hence, user can see the pulse rate and body temperature by using the application. In critical condition, if the pulse rate drastically increases/decreases above or below the threshold value, then a notification will be sent to the doctor.

Maneuver anticipation supplements existing Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by anticipating mishaps and giving drivers more opportunity to respond to road circumstances proactively. The capacity to sort the driver conduct is extremely beneficial for advance driver assistance system (ADAS). Deep learning solutions would further be an endeavor of for driving conduct recognition. A technique for distinguishing driver's conduct is imperative to help operative mode transition between the driver and independent vehicles.

In smart community, residents manage their home appliances to cooperate on stabilizing renewable power supply, energy saving, and information communications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for smart community to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided. In addition, the communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations.},   keywords={cooperative systems;data privacy;home automation;Internet;Internet of Things;wireless LAN;smart community;efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme;Internet bandwidth;pervasive Internet access;cost;EPS;WiFi bandwidth;proximity score;location privacy preservation;multiple pseudonym techniques;privacy analyses;identity privacy;communication efficiency;Internet of Things;Internet of Things;smart community;privacy preservation;cooperative network},   doi={10.1109/JSEN.2013.2263793},   ISSN={1530-437X},   month={Oct},}

Our application example suggests low-pollution routes to citizens in order to lessen their respiratory-related problems, and proactively activates water sprays in fountains to reduce the effect of pollution or pollen. Besides the description of the application, the main contribution of the article is the analysis of the emerging privacy issues of the proposed application and the discussion of possible countermeasures.},   keywords={data privacy;health care;mobile computing;security of data;smart cities;smart health application;s-Health;privacy issues;smart cities;mobile health;m-Health;context-aware health care paradigm;health care systems;security issues;respiratory conditions;low-pollution routes;water sprays;Privacy;Pollution;Medical services;Smart cities;Mobile handsets;Databases;Smart Health;Smart City Architectures;Privacy;Security},   doi={10.1109/SCSPW.2016.7509558},   ISSN={},   month={April},}

Nevertheless, one can be data-rich and knowledge-poor, and this is where the data analytics and the development and application of machine learning models become necessity for gaining insight of complex processes to prove scientific theories and discoveries, support decision making and enhance strategic planning in different areas of the economy, finance, industry, healthcare, etc. Recently, there is an influx of polymorphic, unstructured and multimodal data - social media, images, audio, video, etc., which is complicating further the data processing and knowledge extraction process. But even the traditional structured datasets present problems that need to be addressed and overcome in the early stages of data pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection. This is because they usually contain variety of data formats, e.g., categorical, continuous, ordinal, and frequently missing data (usually result of sensors faults, human errors, collection, transportation, or storage problems). The most popular approaches in dealing with missing data generally fall in three groups: Deletion methods; Single imputation methods; and Model-based methods. In this tutorial I will talk about the third group methods, which are considered to be the most popular, 'modem' model-based approaches. Particularly, Multiple imputation (MI) method will be introduced and discussed in addition to the K-Nearest Neighbour Imputation (KNN-I) and Bagged Tree Imputation (BTI). Subsequently, MI, KNN-I and BTl will be applied in a case study for pre-processing a real world radar signal large dataset (more than 30 000 samples). The dataset comprises intercepted and collected pulse train characteristics, which typically include signal frequencies, type of modulation, scan period, pulse repetition intervals, etc., and usually consist of mixture of continuous, discrete and categorical data, and also frequently include missing values. Missing values are imminent part of real world datasets and radar datasets make no exception of that. Then will briefly talk about supervised and unsupervised learning and the use of three supervised approaches: Neural Networks (NN); Random Forests (RF); and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for solving radar signal classification and source identification problem. Results from applying the NN, RF and SVM (using R and Matlab) on complete data subset (without missing data) and the full dataset with substituted (up to 60%) missing data with MI, KNN-I and BTl will be critically analysed and discussed. Finally, I'll talk about the opportunities and challenges in applying computational intelligence and machine learning techniques to Big Data and the available software for Big Data.},   keywords={Big Data;data analysis;neural nets;radar computing;radar signal processing;random processes;signal classification;unsupervised learning;computational intelligence;data analytics;machine learning models;modem model-based approaches;multiple imputation method;MI method;k-nearest neighbour imputation;KNN-I;bagged tree imputation;BTl;radar signal large dataset preprocessing;unsupervised learning;supervised approaches;neural networks;random forests;RF;support vector machines;SVM;radar signal classification;radar signal source identification problem;Matlab;Big Data;Transportation},   doi={10.1109/TAAI.2015.7407137},   ISSN={2376-6824},   month={Nov},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1993-1996},   abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new internet evolution that involves connecting billions of internet-connected devices that we refer to as IoT things. These devices can communicate directly and intelligently over the Internet, and generate a massive amount of data that needs to be consumed by a variety of IoT applications. This paper focuses on the automatic contextualisation of IoT data, which also involves distilling information and knowledge from the IoT aiming to simplify answering the following fundamental questions that often arises in IoT applications: Which data collected by IoT are relevant to myself and the IoT Things I care for? Related work around context management and contextualisation ranges from database techniques that involve query re-writing, to semantic web and rule-based context management approaches, to machine learning and data science-based solutions in mobile and ambient computing. All such existing approaches have two main aspects in common: They are highly incompatible and horribly inefficient from a scalability and performance perspective. In this paper, we discuss a new RISC Contextualisation Framework (RCF) we have developed, implemented key aspects of, and assess its scalability. RCF provides fundamental contextualisation concepts that can be mapped to all existing contextualisation approaches for IoT data (and in this sense, it provides a common denominator that unifies the contextualisation space). RCF can be easily implemented as a cloud-based service, and provides better scalability and performance that any of the existing content management and contextualisation approaches in the IoT space.},   keywords={Internet;Internet of Things;reduced instruction set computing;efficient contextualisation;Internet of Things;internet evolution;IoT things;automatic information;context management;query re-writing;semantic web;rule-based context management approaches;machine learning;data science-based solutions;mobile computing;ambient computing;RISC contextualisation framework;RCF;cloud-based service;content management;internet-connected devices;Agriculture;Scalability;Vehicles;Smart cities;Intelligent sensors;Knowledge representation;Context;Contextualisation;Scalability;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/ICDCS.2017.308},   ISSN={1063-6927},   month={June},}

In this paper, we consider the service intelligence in m-Health (so called smart services). On the one hand, such a service utilizes the telemedicine approach when existing healthcare services (located in hospital) are delivered to remote patients (out of hospital). On the other hand, construction and delivery of a smart service benefit from additional intelligence attributes, beyond a fixed set of healthcare services of a given medical information system. For this promising class of m-Health services, we introduce reference scenarios of personalized assistance for a mobile patient with focus on emergency cases.

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={335-342},   abstract={With the advent of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart sensor technologies, the data-driven paradigm has been found promising to support human behavioral analysis in a smart home for better healthcare and well-being of senior adults. This work focuses on discovering daily activity routines from sensor data collected in a smart home. By representing the sensor data as a matrix, daily activity routines can be identified using matrix factorization methods. The key challenge rests on the fact that the matrix contains discrete labels as its elements, and decomposing the nominal data matrix into basis vectors of the labels is nontrivial. We propose a novel principled methodology to tackle the nominal matrix factorization problem. Assuming that the similarity matrix of the labels is known, the discrete labels are first projected onto a continuous space with the interlabel distance preserving the given similarity matrix of the labels as far as possible. Then, we extend a hierarchical probabilistic model for ordinal matrix factorization with Bayesian Lasso that the factorization can be more robust to noise and more sparse to ease human interpretation. Our experimental results based on a synthetic data set shows that the factorization results obtained using the proposed methodology outperform those obtained using a number of the state-of-the-art factorization methods in terms of the basis vector reconstruction accuracy. We also applied our model to a publicly available smart home data set to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used to support daily activity routine analysis.},   keywords={Bayes methods;behavioural sciences;data mining;health care;home automation;intelligent sensors;intelligent structures;Internet of Things;matrix decomposition;mobile computing;pattern clustering;vectors;Bayesian nominal matrix factorization;activity pattern mining;Internet of Things;IoT;smart sensor technologies;data-driven paradigm;human behavioral analysis;smart home;health care;senior adult well-being;sensor data collection;nominal data matrix decomposition;basis vectors;hierarchical probabilistic model;ordinal matrix factorization;Bayesian lasso;human interpretation;basis vector reconstruction accuracy;daily activity routine analysis;Sparse matrices;Matrix decomposition;Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic;Manganese;Smart homes;Robustness;Nominal matrix factorization;probabilistic hierarchical model;Bayesian inference;routine pattern discovery},   doi={10.1109/WI.2016.0054},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={33-38},   abstract={The fast growing and the aging of the population are some of the major problems today in terms of medical treatment in public or private hospitals. In this context, particularly talking about the health equipments belonging to each hospital, we also observe that governments and administrators still face difficulties in overseeing the tracking, allocation and management of such equipments in real-time. The gap of acquiring a global overview about what each hospital has or not invariably leads to resource wasting in some places, while there is a lacking of resources in others, so providing a deficient service at regional or national scale. Here, we are proposing the EMH (Elastic Multi-hospital Management) model, which uses the cloud elasticity facility to provide a distributed framework for managing things including physical spaces and objects at real-time within the context of multiple healthcare institutions. Our solution consists in offering a centralized management control center that works with cloud elasticity to enlarge or reduce the number of virtual machines to support the variable incoming demands from the hospitals. Thus, the idea is to subsidize real-time decision making in favor of managers who can, for instance, plan expansions, new health policies or equipment exchanges between hospitals. EMH is based on the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) sensor tracking technology, combined with the client-server Web Service concept, to detect motion and usability of objects. Finally, we developed a prototype of the EMH model which emphasized the benefits on providing a unique administration point and handling incoming workload with cloud elasticity to address user requests inside an acceptable response time (here denoted as lower than 200 ms).},   keywords={biomedical equipment;client-server systems;cloud computing;decision making;health care;medical information systems;radio tracking;radiofrequency identification;virtual machines;Web services;object elastic management;physical space elastic management;multihospital environments;medical treatment;health equipments;elastic multihospital management model;EMH model;cloud elasticity facility;distributed framework;multiple healthcare institutions;centralized management control center;virtual machines;real-time decision making;RFID;radio-frequency identification sensor tracking technology;client-server Web service;motion detection;Hospitals;Cloud computing;Elasticity;Radiofrequency identification;Databases;Hospitals;Performance;Cloud;Elasticity},   doi={10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.33},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={149-153},   abstract={Many application scenarios for IoT (Internet of Things) require the interconnection of high speed sensing nodes with data rates of Gbps. As an example surveillance or smart mobility applications adopt multiple photo and video cameras working at different spectral range (visible, near infrared, far infrared) and covering different fields of view, or they exploit arrays of radio/light detection and ranging (Radar/Lidar) sensors to detect the presence of targets, of their speeds, distance and direction. Even the access of distributed nodes in IoT towards a centralized cloud storage/processing center requires high data rate connections. Since low size and low weight of the nodes are needed, IoT can benefit from the high communication data rate, several Gbps, that can be provided by fully integrated mm-wave wireless transceivers. The wavelength at such frequency is few mm and hence the whole transceiver including the antenna can be integrated in a single chip. To this aim, this paper presents the design of 60 GHz transceiver key blocks (Low Noise Amplifier, Power Amplifier, Antenna) to ensure connection distances up to 10 m and data rate of several Gbps. Around 60 GHz worldwide there are freely-available (unlicensed) several GHz of bandwidth. By using a CMOS SOI technology RF, analog and digital baseband circuitry can be integrated in the same chip minimizing noise coupling. Even the antenna is integrated on chip reducing cost and size vs. classic off-chip antenna solutions. The proposed transceiver allows for the implementation of low cost nodes for IoT systems with data rates of several Gbps and with a 10 m link distance. These specifications are suitable for home/office scenarios, or for body area networks (healthcare, wellness) or for applications on board vehicles (cars, trains, ships, airplanes).},   keywords={body area networks;body sensor networks;CMOS integrated circuits;Internet of Things;millimetre wave amplifiers;millimetre wave antennas;mobility management (mobile radio);optical radar;radio transceivers;sensor arrays;silicon-on-insulator;millimetre-wave integrated wireless transceivers;high bandwidth connections;IoT systems;Internet-of-things;high speed sensing nodes;high communication data rate;smart mobility applications;radio detection-and-ranging sensor array;light detection-and-ranging sensor array;centralized cloud storage center;centralized cloud processing center;CMOS SOI technology RF;analog baseband circuitry;digital baseband circuitry;noise coupling minimization;wireless sensor networks;frequency 60 GHz;Gain;Transceivers;CMOS integrated circuits;Wireless sensor networks;CMOS technology;Noise figure;Antennas;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN);IoT (Internet of Things);High-speed network;mm-wave integrated transceiver},   doi={10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389043},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

However, today's radio spectrum is very crowded for the rapid increasing popularities of various wireless applications. Hence, WSN utilizing the advantages of cognitive radio technology, namely, cognitive radio-based WSN (CR-WSN), is a promising solution for spectrum scarcity problem of IoT applications. A major challenge in CR-WSN is utilizing spectrum more efficiently. Therefore, a novel channel access scheme is proposed for the problem that how to access the multiple channels with the unknown environment information for cognitive users, so as to maximize system throughput. The problem is modeled as I.I.D. multi-armed bandit model with M cognitive users and N arms (M&amp;lt;;N). In order to solve the competition and the fairness between cognitive users of WSNs, a fair channel-grouping scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme divides these channels into M groups according to the water-filling principle based on the learning algorithm UCB-K index, the number of channels not less than one in each group and then allocate channel group for each cognitive user by using distributed learning algorithm fairly. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme cannot only effectively solve the problem of collision between the cognitive users, improve the utilization rate of the idle spectrum, and at the same time reflect the fairness of selecting channels between cognitive users.},   keywords={cognitive radio;Internet of Things;wireless sensor networks;multi armed bandit channel access scheme;cognitive radio technology;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;spectrum scarcity problem;fair channel-grouping scheme;water-filling principle;distributed learning algorithm;Internet of things;Wireless sensor networks;Cognitive radio;Medical services;Agriculture;I.I.D. multi-armed bandit;fairness access scheme;channel-grouping;modified UCB-tuned},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2600633},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

This paper describes the process of designing Tethys, a wireless water flow sensor that collects data at per-fixture granularity without dependence on existing infrastructure and trusted gateways. Rather than rely on electrical infrastructure, Tethys implements energy harvesting to allow for long term deployment. To avoid dependence on existing network infrastructure, Tethys crowdsources the data collection process to residents' smartphones acting as gateways. These gateways are untrusted and unreliable, so Tethys implements end-to-end reliability and security between the sensing device and a cloud backend. We present initial findings from a deployment in undergraduate residential halls. Our results demonstrate that Tethys can capture meaningful patterns in shower use.

IEEE 802.11s may exploit multi-channel multi-interface wireless routers to increase the through-put.

 title={Composition-Driven IoT Service Provisioning in Distributed Edges}, 
  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={54258-54269},   abstract={The increasing number of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices and services makes it convenient for people to sense the real world and makes optimal decisions or complete complex tasks with them. However, the latency brought by unstable wireless networks and computation failures caused by constrained resources limit the development of IoT. A popular approach to solve this problem is to establish an IoT service provision system based on a mobile edge computing (MEC) model. In the MEC model, plenty of edge servers are placed with access points via wireless networks. With the help of cached services on edge servers, the latency can be reduced, and the computation can be offloaded. The cache services must be carefully selected so that many requests can by satisfied without overloading resources in edge servers.

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={10332-10340},   abstract={The security of sensitive information is an urgent need in today's communication, principally in cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Therefore, a well-designed security mechanism should be carefully considered. This paper presents a new framework for secure information in fog cloud IoT. In the framework, the user in one location embeds his/her valuable data via the proposed quantum steganography protocol and uploads the covered data to the fog cloud. The intended receiver in another location accesses the data from the fog cloud and extracts the intended content via the proposed extraction approach. This paper also presents a novel quantum steganography protocol based on hash function and quantum entangled states. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior quantum steganography protocol that authenticates an embedded secret message. In the suggested protocol, the hash function is utilized to authenticate embedded secret messages. The presented protocol is secure against well-known attacks, such as message, man-in-the-middle, and no-message attacks. In addition, it does not consume additional channels besides the proposed one to send a secret message or verify security. The proposed approach is nominated for use in fog and mobile edge computing.},   keywords={cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things;quantum cryptography;quantum entanglement;steganography;fog cloud Internet of Things;sensitive information;secure quantum steganography protocol;no-message attacks;embedded secret message;quantum entangled states;hash function;intended content;intended receiver;fog cloud IoT;secure information;Protocols;Cloud computing;Quantum entanglement;Authentication;Reflective binary codes;Edge computing;Quantum steganography;authentication;Internet of Things;fog computing;cloud computing},   doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2799879},   ISSN={2169-3536},   month={},}

 title={Side-Channel Leakage Models for RISC Instruction Set Architectures from Empirical Data}, 
  year={2015},   volume={},   number={},   pages={423-430},   abstract={Side-channel attacks are currently among the most serious threats for embedded systems. Popular countermeasures to mitigate the impact of such attacks are masking schemes, where secret intermediate values are split in two or more values by virtue of secret sharing. Processing the secret happens on separate execution paths, which are executed on the same central processing unit (CPU). In case of unwanted correlations between different registers inside the CPU the shared secret may leak out through a side-channel. This problem is particularly evident on low cost embedded systems, such as nodes for the Internet of Things (IoT), where cryptographic algorithms are often implemented in pure software on a reduced instruction set computer (RISC). On such an architecture, all data manipulation operations are carried out on the contents of the CPU's register file. This means that all intermediate values of the cryptographic algorithm at some stage pass through the register file. Towards avoiding unwanted correlations and leakages thereof, special care has to be taken in the mapping of the registers to intermediate values of the algorithm. In this work, we describe an empirical study that reveals effects of unintended unmasking of masked intermediate values and thus leaking secret values. The observed phenomena are related to the leakage of masked hardware implementations caused by glitches in the combinatorial path of the circuit but the effects are abstracted to the level of the instruction set architecture on a RISC CPU. Furthermore, we discuss countermeasures to have the compiler thwart such leakages.},   keywords={cryptography;embedded systems;program compilers;reduced instruction set computing;side-channel leakage models;RISC instruction set architectures;side-channel attacks;embedded systems;masking schemes;secret sharing;central processing unit;data manipulation operations;cryptographic algorithm;masked hardware implementations;RISC CPU;compiler;Registers;Correlation;Cryptography;Computer architecture;Reduced instruction set computing;Central Processing Unit;Hamming distance},   doi={10.1109/DSD.2015.117},   ISSN={},   month={Aug},}

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={676-681},   abstract={While the Internet of Things is breaking into the market, the controlled access to constrained resources still remains a blocking concern. Unfortunately, conventional solutions already accepted for both web and cloud applications cannot be directly used in this context. In fact, they generally require high computational and bandwidth capabilities (that are impossible to reach with constrained devices) and offer poor interoperability against standardized communication protocols for the Internet of Things. To solve this issue, this contribution presents a flexible authentication and authorization framework for the Internet of Things, namely OAuth-IoT. It leverages and properly harmonizes existing open-standards (including the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, different token formats, and the protocol suite for the Internet of Things tailored by the Internet Engineering Task Force), while carefully taking into account the limited capabilities of constrained devices. Functionalities and benefits offered by OAuth-IoT are pragmatically shown by means of an experimental testbed, and further demonstrated with a very preliminary performance assessment.},   keywords={authorisation;Internet of Things;performance assessment;constrained devices;Internet Engineering Task Force;protocol suite;token formats;authorization framework;flexible authentication;standardized communication protocols;interoperability;cloud applications;Web applications;open standards;Internet of Things;access control framework;OAuth-IoT;Authorization;Servers;Protocols;Logic gates;Standards;Internet of Things},   doi={10.1109/ISCC.2017.8024606},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

In this paper, the virtual PHR concept is introduced as an entity on the network consisted of (a) a non-healthcare component containing health and social information collected by either the patient or non-healthcare providers, (b) a medical device component containing health information transmitted from Internet connected medical devices and (c) a healthcare professional component containing information stored into various healthcare information systems. The PHR concept is based on the patient-centered model dictating that patients are the owners of their information. Hence, patients are empowered to authorize other subjects to access it that introduces specific security challenges which are further accentuated by the fact that diverse local security policies may need to be reconciled. The PHR authorization system proposed here is based on a combination of role-based and attribute-based access control (RABAC) and supports patient-specified authorization policies of various granularity levels subject to constraints imposed by the security policies of the various health and social care providers involved. To this end, an ontology of granular security concepts is built to aid in semantically matching diverse authorization requests and to enable semantic rule reasoning on whether a requested access should be permitted or denied.},   keywords={authorisation;electronic health records;granular computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic matching;semantic rule reasoning;personal health record;role-based access control;attribute-based access control;granular security concepts;ontology;social care providers;health care providers;granularity levels;patient-specified authorization policies;RABAC;local security policies;data access;patient-centered model;healthcare information systems;information storage;healthcare professional component;health information transmission;medical device component;nonhealthcare providers;social information collection;health information collection;nonhealthcare component;patient data;IOT;Internet of things;cloud computing;virtual PHR authorization system;Authorization;Ontologies;Medical services;Cloud computing;Semantics;Filtering},   doi={10.1109/BHI.2014.6864307},   ISSN={2168-2194},   month={June},}

CVDs rank #1 in the world when it comes to diseases causing deaths. More people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. Around 17 million people died from CVDs in the year 2012, representing 31% of all global deaths. In India alone there are around 64 million cardiac patients and only 4000 cardiologists available. Arrhythmia is the most frequent occurring CVD. Patients having Arrhythmia require continuous monitoring so that the doctor can study the abnormality in their heart beats to gain further insights and suggest treatments. In some cases Arrhythmia can be fatal and might need immediate hospitalization. For this purpose, we have developed a system that remotely acquires ECG sensor readings (taken from MIT-BIH database) of the patient, processes it to predict arrhythmia intelligently and sends the indication alarm immediately to the doctor, when an Arrhythmia episode is detected. Also a report of the patient's heart behavior is generated and fetched to the doctor on his smart phone.

Nowadays, they are entitled to drive innovation and competition in different fields such as agriculture, building design and automation, energy, healthcare, transportation and, above all, industrial manufacturing. In fact, CPS technology is going to transform the way people interact with engineered systems - just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. Among CPS technologies, measurement and networking ones play a fundamental role, being enrolled as the natural bridge between the cyber and physical components of a CPS. A number of interconnected sensors and transducers are claimed to give inner and outer, local measurement data that, once processed through suitable algorithms and analytics, have to provide reliable information about the effectiveness of the whole CPS and its interaction with the external world, as well as its health status for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. So, great attention has to be paid to network models and architectures, to sensor forms and functions, in order to make CPSs properly integrate the continuous and the discrete, compounded by the uncertainty of open environments. The paper aims at opening a preliminary discussion on the role and features of measurement and networking technologies in CPS application fields, with special regard to industrial manufacturing, within a scientific community traditionally close to instrumentation and measurement (IM) issues, in order to stimulate and encourage useful and fruitful cross-fertilization. After some details concerning the general structure of a CPS, its typical architectural model and main features, a special focus is put on CPSs involved in industrial manufacturing along with measurement and networking facets.

  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-10},   abstract={Sensitive personal user-data collected by Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is vulnerable to information leaks when uploaded to third-party cloud computing infrastructures. Even though data is encrypted before being sent, to perform analyses on the received data, the computing infrastructure typically decrypts the data, and then performs computation. Therefore, during computation, data can be leaked by means of honest-but-curious system administrators. To overcome this vulnerability, homomorphic encryption enables "blind" computation directly on encrypted data, thus rendering obsolete any data leaks. However, homomorphic encryption is highly resource demanding, as it performs many compute-intensive operations during encryption, while also increasing the size of ciphertexts, which makes it unsuitable for low-powered (mobile) IoT devices. For similar reasons, performing operations on encrypted data is also a challenging task, especially when real-time decision-making is needed. In such scenarios, efficient solutions must be augmented by placing computation close to the data: at the network edge. In this paper, we introduce privacy preserving SWAN (P2-SWAN), a homomorphic-encryption enabled mobile computing framework. Even though such encryption adds significant computational overhead, our evaluation shows that it is feasible on low-powered (mobile) devices. The overhead induced on such devices is minimized due to our carefully crafted implementation. We show that performing encrypted operations achieves excellent scalability, thus only modest numbers of computing servers can handle the load for data generated by millions of devices. Furthermore, our proposed approach achieves real-time computation not only for encrypting data on mobile devices, but also for performing encrypted computation.},   keywords={cryptography;data privacy;mobile computing;homomorphic-encryption enabled mobile computing framework;real-time decision-making;Internet-of-Things devices;IoT ecosystems;real-time privacy preserving computation;P<sup>2</sup>-SWAN;Sensors;Encryption;Performance evaluation;Real-time systems;Cloud computing;Mobile handsets},   doi={10.1109/ICFEC.2017.11},   ISSN={},   month={May},}

  year={2018},   volume={6},   number={},   pages={1-12},   abstract={The health of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) can change frequently and inexplicably. Crucial events and activities responsible for these changes often go unnoticed. This paper introduces healthcare event and action logging (HEAL) which automatically and unobtrusively monitors and reports on events and activities that occur in a medical ICU room. HEAL uses a multimodal distributed camera network to monitor and identify ICU activities and estimate sanitation-event qualifiers. At the core is a novel approach to infer person roles based on<italic>semantic interactions</italic>, a critical requirement in many healthcare settings where individuals’ identities must not be identified. The proposed approach for activity representation identifies contextual aspects basis and estimates aspect weights for proper action representation and reconstruction. The flexibility of the proposed algorithms enables the identification of people roles by associating them with inferred interactions and detected activities. A fully working prototype system is developed, tested in a mock ICU room and then deployed in two ICU rooms at a community hospital, thus offering unique capabilities for data gathering and analytics. The proposed method achieves a role identification accuracy of 84% and a backtracking role identification of 79% for obscured roles using interaction and appearance features on real ICU data. Detailed experimental results are provided in the context of four event-sanitation qualifiers: clean, transmission, contamination, and unclean.},   keywords={Monitoring;Cameras;Hospitals;Sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Lighting;Contextual aspects for events and activities;smart ICU;medical Internet of Things;multimodal sensor network},   doi={10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2863386},   ISSN={2168-2372},   month={},}

In order to make it possible and to facilitate transmission of IPv6 packets over low powered networks, 6LoWPAN [9,11] has been introduced. 6LoWPAN incorporates an adaptation layer between network and data link layers. Two routing schemes are used in 6LoWPAN depending on which layer takes routing, forwarding decisions. If adaptation layer takes the decision, then it is called mesh under, whereas if the network layer is involved, then the scheme is route over. In this paper, we present a comparative study of these two schemes. Various performance metrics, such as average round-trip time delay, end to end delay and packet delivery ratio are compared and suitability of the two schemes are analyzed for a Sensor-Grid infrastructure.

Differentiated from 4G, a benefit offered by 5G is much more than the increased maximum throughput. It aims to involve and benefit from many current technical advances including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As the IIoT integrates many heterogeneous networks, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Mobile Communication Networks (3G/4G/LTE/5G), Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) and wearable health care systems, it is critical to design self-organizing and smart protocols for heterogeneous ad hoc networks in various IoT applications, such as cyber-physical systems, cloud computing for heterogeneous ad hoc networks, large-scale sensor networks, data acquisition from distributed smart devices, green communication and applications, environmental monitoring and control, etc. Moreover, based on the survey conducted by the World Health Organization, the world will lack 12.9 million healthcare workers by 2035. Hence, it is important to develop wearable healthcare systems to perform self-health monitoring. In general, wearable healthcare systems demands low power consumption and high measurement accuracy. Smart technologies including green electronics, green radios, fuzzy neural approaches and intelligent signal processing techniques play important roles in the developments of the wearable healthcare systems. Therefore, this special issue provides a forum to discuss the recent advances on 5G and beyond mobile technologies and applications for IIoT.},   keywords={Special issues and sections;Wearable computers;Wireless communication;Internet of Things;Wireless sensor networks;5G mobile communication;Informatics;Long Term Evolution},   doi={10.1109/TII.2018.2823311},   ISSN={1551-3203},   month={June},}

CRAHNs are equipped with the intrinsic capabilities of cognition and self-organization, providing a flexible spectrum- aware communication paradigm in wireless networks. Since available spectrum mostly manifests as several discontinuous frequency ranges, CRAHNs should be able to operate on multiple frequency channels. Multi-channel CRAHNs can alleviate interference and improve the spectrum utilization with greater fl exibility for channel access. The promising applications of multi-channel CRAHNs include large-scale machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, the Internet of Things (IoTs), high-density Wi-Fi, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms. Multi-channel CRAHNs impose unique challenges due to the distributed dynamic network topology and the temporal or spatial variations in spectrum availability. To overcome these challenges, fundamental problems in multi-channel CRAHNs have to be carefully resolved with respect to spectrum sensing, convention resolution, network topology maintenance, and application support. },   keywords={Special issues and sections;Cognitive radio;Ad hoc networks;Network topology;Image segmentation;Sensors;Tutorials},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.8337910},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={APRIL},}

Age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and psychological diseases have become the primary killers of human and consume the major portion of healthcare resources due to the long course of disease and large patient base. Powered by the technologies originated from manufacturing industries driven by the fourth revolution of industry (Industry 4.0), the fourth revolution in healthcare technologies (Healthcare 4.0) is also happening as envisioned by Pang et al.

In the Healthcare 4.0, vast amount of cyber and physical systems (CPS) are closely combined through the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent sensing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, automatic control, and autonomous execution and robotics to create not only digitalized healthcare products and technologies but also digitalized healthcare services and enterprises.

A looming problem is how to identify a frequency band, from the already scarce spectrum resources, to fulfill this requirement. A feasible cost-efficient solution is to integrate several existing network resources, which have been allocated for different services, to form a single mobile converged network. These existing networks operate independently on different frequency bands, including the cellular network, video broadcast, wireless sensor network (WSN), and wireless local area network (WLAN). Each of them, alone, has its own historic justification, but suffers certain drawbacks in one way or another. For instance, the cellular network was originally designed to offer voice service, lacking an efficient means of broadcasting multimedia contents. Clearly, integrating these heterogeneous networks will constitute a much more powerful unified framework able to fully exploit the capability and radio resources of all the individual networks, provide a platform for the Internet of Things, and enable users to enjoy a uniform service everywhere by using a software-defined radio device. The benefits of converged networks are promising; however, the road to success is filled with challenges. The networks integration necessitates a harmonious interaction among heterogeneous networks at different levels, thus requiring a careful design of network architecture, coordination protocols, and resource allocation algorithms for efficient operation of the converged network.},   keywords={Special issues and sections;Mobile communication;Computer architecture;Multimedia communication;Resource management;Convergence;Mobile computing},   doi={10.1109/MWC.2014.7000966},   ISSN={1536-1284},   month={December},}

  year={2011},   volume={49},   number={11},   pages={30-31},   abstract={The Internet has experienced a tremendous growth in the past three decades, evolving from a network of a few hundred hosts to a platform linking billions of "things" globally, including individual people as well as enterprises of various sizes, through computers and computerized devices of any conceivable size and capability and the applications running on them. The growth of the Internet shows no signs of slowing down and it steadily becomes the cause of a new pervasive paradigm in computing and communications. This new paradigm enhances the traditional Internet into a smart Internet of Things (IoT) created around intelligent interconnections of diverse objects in the physical world, such as vehicles, cell phones, habitats, and habitat occupants. It utilizes low-cost information gathering and dissemination devices, such as sensors and RFID tags, that facilitate fast-paced interactions among the objects themselves as well as the objects and persons in any place and at any time. IoT will usher in a wide range of smart applications and services to cope with many of the challenges individuals and organizations face in their everyday lives. For example, remote healthcare monitoring systems could aid in managing costs and alleviating the shortage of healthcare personnel; intelligent transportation systems could aid in reducing traffic congestion and inevitably the ills caused by it such as air pollution; smart distribution systems from utility grids to supply chains could aid in improving the quality and reducing the cost of their respective goods and services; tagged objects could result in more systematic recycling and effective waste disposal, and so on.},   keywords={Special issues and sections;Internet;Mobile communication;Computer applications},   doi={10.1109/MCOM.2011.6069706},   ISSN={0163-6804},   month={November},}

 title={DIY home security}, 
  year={2016},   volume={53},   number={1},   pages={20-21},   abstract={The last straw was a midday break-in right next door. For months, my wife and I had worried that our neighborhood in the Seattle suburbs was suffering from a nasty rash of home burglaries. We had toyed with getting a security system for our house but balked at the monthly fees and installation hassle of conventional systems. Then our neighbors alerted us that intruders had just busted into their home-only a few meters from ours-in broad daylight. I started researching DIY security systems the next day. Thanks to advances in mesh networking and Internet-of-Things standards like Zigbee and Z-Wave, the market has exploded with wireless security systems that are easy to install and expand, connected to smartphone apps, and much more affordable than their hardwired counterparts. Most of them include built-in batteries and 3G cellular radios, so they still work if the power or Internet router goes down. As I waded through the support forums of several promising-looking systems, however, I noticed a common complaint: Their sirens are pathetic. The “siren is not loud enough” thread on Scout Alarm's website, for example, had 156 posts from unhappy customers, along with (as yet unfulfilled) promises from the company to fix the issue by redesigning the case. It's surprising that none of the DIY systems make enough noise to scare off would-be thieves (or include terminals for connecting an external siren). Apparently their designers didn't have deterrence in mind. . I decided to order a Scout system nevertheless. It offered the sensors I needed at an attractive price. I liked that it works with IFTTT (If This Then That), an IoT-unifying Web-based service that I wanted to use to flash a Lifx lightbulb on my nightstand when the alarm goes off. And I had an idea for amplifying the siren to be as loud as I wanted-an idea that should work with any security system, IFTTT-enabled or not (IFTTT can be sluggish responding to a trigger, not the kind of thing you want when trying to stop burglars in their tracks). All I had to do was to build a follower siren.},   keywords={3G mobile communication;alarm systems;home automation;mobile computing;Web services;Seattle suburbs;home burglaries;DIY security systems;mesh networking;Internet-of-Things standards;Zigbee;Z-Wave;wireless security systems;smartphone apps;built-in batteries;3G cellular radios;Scout system;IFTTT;IoT-unifying Web-based service;Lifx lightbulb;follower siren},   doi={10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7367451},   ISSN={0018-9235},   month={January},}

 title={Keynote speakers: Cyber-human partnerships — Towards a resilient ecosystem in smart cities}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={xi-xiv},   abstract={In this talk I will explore one of the most relevant challenges for a decade to come: How to integrate the Internet of Things with software, people, and processes, considering modern Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) with Big Data. I will present a fresh look at this problem, and examine how to integrate people, software services, and things with their data, into one novel resilient ecosystem, which can be modeled, programmed, and deployed on a large scale in an elastic way. This novel paradigm has major consequences on how we view, build, design, and deploy ultra-large scale distributed systems and establishes a novel foundation for an “architecure of value” driven Smart City. Current technological progress in multidimensional and multimodal acquisition of biomedical data enables detailed investigation of the individual health status that should underpin improved patient diagnosis and treatment outcome. However, the abundance of biomedical information has not always been translated directly in improved healthcare. It rather increases the current information deluge and desperately calls for more holistic ways to analyse and assimilate patient data in an effective manner. The Virtual Physiological Human aims at developing the framework and tools that would ultimately enable such integrated investigation of the human body and rendering methods for personalized and predictive medicine. This keynote speech will focus on and illustrate two specific aspects: a) how the integration of biomedical imaging and sensing, signal and image computing and computational physiology are essential components in addressing this personalized, predictive and integrative healthcare challenge, and b) how such principles could be put at work to address specific clinical questions in the cardiovascular domain. Finally, this talk will also underline the important role of model validation as a key to translational success and how such validations span from technical validation of specific modeling components to clinical assessment of the effectiveness of the proposed tools. To conclude, the talk will outline some of the areas where current research efforts fall short in the VPH domain and that will possibly receive further investigation in the upcoming years. If we look at some of the goals of 5G versus where we are today, we can see the gap that has to be bridged over the next few years. The goal of 1ms latency is nearly 50x better than current LTE systems. In order to go from 100Mbps per user to 10Gbps, we need 100x the throughput per connection. The current 10,000 connections per square kilometer needs to increase to 1Million connections, which corresponds to 100x increase in density. Reliable communications today with LTE top out about 350km/h and we expect to bring that up by 1.5x to 500km/h. Finally, the current core networks and backhaul/fronthaul are inflexible with wasted pools of bandwidth. The introduction of SDN/NFV will allow much better ability to chop up and virtualize the network resources for lower operational costs and capital costs and much greater flexibility. In this talk, we will give an update on standardization process and the challenges ahead for a true deployment by 2020. Fractional Calculus (FC) started in 1695 when L'Hopital wrote a letter to Leibniz asking for the meaning of D<sup>n</sup>y for n = 1/2. Starting with the ideas of Leibniz many important mathematicians developed the theoretical concepts. By the beginning of the twentieth century Olivier Heaviside applied FC in the electrical engineering, but, the visionary and important contributions were forgotten. Only during the eighties FC emerged associated with phenomena such as fractal and chaos and, consequently, in nonlinear dynamical. In the last years, FC become ‘new’ tool for the analysis of dynamical systems. This lecture introduces the FC fundamental concepts and presents several applications in distinct areas of science and engineering.},   keywords={},   doi={10.1109/TSP.2017.8075923},   ISSN={},   month={July},}

The best-known example of such an intelligent system is the smart grid. The same technologies that enabled the smart grid are being applied to many other types of physical systems. Intelligent systems are rapidly emerging in transportation, buildings, other energy infrastructures (e.g., gas, oil, and water), manufacturing, emergency response, and health care. Of course, the smart grid provides an essential foundation since all types of intelligent systems depend on reliable and high-quality electricity to power their operation. Various writers use terms such as cyberphysical systems,” “industrial Internet,” and the “Internet of Things (IOT )” to refer to what we are calling “intelligent systems.” While these terms do not necessarily mean the same thing, they all bring to mind a common set of enabling technologies that are making physical systems intelligent.},   keywords={Intelligent systems;Smart grids;Systems operation;Productivity;Industries;Technological innovation},   doi={10.1109/MELE.2015.2509904},   ISSN={2325-5897},   month={March},}

 title={Smart data — How you and I will exploit Big Data for personalized digital health and many other activities}, 
  year={2014},   volume={},   number={},   pages={2-3},   abstract={Summary form only given. Big Data has captured a lot of interest in industry, with the emphasis on the challenges of the four Vs of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their applications to drive value for businesses. Recently, there is rapid growth in situations where a big data challenge relates to making individually relevant decisions. A key example is personalized digital health that related to taking better decisions about our health, fitness, and well-being. Consider for instance, understanding the reasons for and avoiding an asthma attack based on Big Data in the form of personal health signals (e.g., physiological data measured by devices/sensors or Internet of Things around humans, on the humans, and inside/within the humans), public health signals (e.g., information coming from the healthcare system such as hospital admissions), and population health signals (such as Tweets by people related to asthma occurrences and allergens, Web services providing pollen and smog information). However, no individual has the ability to process all these data without the help of appropriate technology, and each human has different set of relevant data! In this talk, I will describe Smart Data that is realized by extracting value from Big Data, to benefit not just large companies but each individual. If my child is an asthma patient, for all the data relevant to my child with the four V-challenges, what I care about is simply, “How is her current health, and what are the risk of having an asthma attack in her current situation (now and today), especially if that risk has changed?” As I will show, Smart Data that gives such personalized and actionable information will need to utilize metadata, use domain specific knowledge, employ semantics and intelligent processing, and go beyond traditional reliance on ML and NLP. I will motivate the need for a synergistic combination of techniques similar to the close interworking of the top brain and the bottom brain in the cognitive models. For harnessing volume, I will discuss the concept of Semantic Perception, that is, how to convert massive amounts of data into information, meaning, and insight useful for human decision-making. For dealing with Variety, I will discuss experience in using agreement represented in the form of ontologies, domain models, or vocabularies, to support semantic interoperability and integration. For Velocity, I will discuss somewhat more recent work on Continuous Semantics, which seeks to use dynamically created models of new objects, concepts, and relationships, using them to better understand new cues in the data that capture rapidly evolving events and situations. Smart Data applications in development at Kno.e.sis come from the domains of personalized health, energy, disaster response, and smart city. I will present examples from a couple of these.},   keywords={Big Data;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;smart data;Big Data;personalized digital health;metadata;domain specific knowledge;intelligent processing;semantic perception;ontologies;domain models;vocabularies;semantic interoperability;continuous semantics;Big Data volume;Big Data variety;Big Data velocity;Big Data veracity},   doi={10.1109/BigData.2014.7004204},   ISSN={},   month={Oct},}

 title={Energy efficiency and the role of IoT in a smart city connected community}, 
  year={2017},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Energy efficiency and IoT deployments offer a much higher value proposition if these can function in the context of a smart city in a connected community. These can then contribute more to the safety, security and improve the environment in which the citizens live and work. In order to make urban living more safe, secure and environmentally sustainable, the focus needs to be on environmental quality, public safety, city planning, industry facilitation, resource utilization, energy conservation, traffic control, telemedicine, homecare, interpersonal communications, social activities and entertainment. A smart city relies on widely distributed smart (IoT) devices to monitor the urban environment in real-time, collect information for intelligent decision making, and facilitate various services to improve the quality of urban living. The distributed network of intelligent sensor nodes, as well as data centers/clouds where sensor data are stored and shared, constitutes a smart city infrastructure. Participatory sensing plays an indispensable role in emerging initiatives of a smart city, which retrieves sensor data from groups of people or communities. The proliferation of personal mobile devices and development of online social networks make participatory sensing viable at a large scale but introduce many open problems at the same time. Smart cities address urban challenges such as pollution, energy efficiency, security, parking, traffic, transportation, and others by utilizing advanced information and communication technologies (ICT) in data gathering and communications interconnectivity via the Internet. It provides real time and remote monitoring for different aspects of data management in areas such as transportation, communication, video surveillance, and sensor integration throughout the city.},   keywords={cloud computing;decision making;energy conservation;intelligent sensors;Internet;Internet of Things;mobile computing;sensor fusion;smart cities;social networking (online);town and country planning;IoT devices;smart city connected community;IoT devices;intelligent decision making;data centers/clouds;personal mobile devices;online social networks;urban challenges;advanced information and communication technologies;data gathering;ICT;communications interconnectivity;Internet;data management;smart city infrastructure;sensor data;widely distributed smart devices;city planning;energy efficiency;Smart cities;Energy efficiency;Safety;Security;Real-time systems;Distributed databases},   doi={10.1109/ICCITECHN.2017.8281862},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

  year={2013},   volume={},   number={},   pages={vii-vii},   abstract={As computer and signal processing speed increase, information transmission efficiencies reach within a fraction of a dB of Shannon's Limit, SDRs (software defined radios) take radio communications to the “next level”, the “internet of things” (IoT) already connecting over 10 billion devices wirelessly, and the ITU declaring in 2013 that Asia has become the largest M2M market in the world, the adjective “ubiquitous” is no longer the exaggeration it has represented for years but rather a very accurate description of tomorrow's communications. Within a few years Indonesia, driven by its population and need for multiple forms of telecommunications as a result of our environment, will experience the ability to create, access, transfer and share information from any location, using many different kinds of devices from wrist bands to computers embedded in our eyeglasses, and do so in true multi-tasking modes. Soon we will not know the path information flows, nor will we care. Self-healing networks, least cost routing, QoS driven route management, congestion sensors, security requirements, and neural networking will determine routing. We will forget about how difficult it is to make a mobile call of reasonable quality today and focus more on the quality of the communication experience tomorrow.},   keywords={data communication;fault tolerant computing;Internet of Things;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);neural nets;quality of service;software radio;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;ubiquitous communication;signal processing;information transmission efficiencies;Shannon's Limit;SDR;software defined radio;radio communication;Internet of things;IoT;ITU;M2M market;information flow;self-healing network;network routing;QoS;route management;congestion sensor;security requirements;neural network;Educational institutions;Companies;Internet;Computers;Routing;Cities and towns},   doi={10.1109/COMNETSAT.2013.6870843},   ISSN={},   month={Dec},}

 title={A changing landscape: Securing the Internet of Things (IoT): Keynote talk}, 
  year={2016},   volume={},   number={},   pages={1-1},   abstract={Summary form only given. First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.},   keywords={body sensor networks;Internet of Things;radio links;security of data;wireless sensor networks;Internet of Things security;IoT security;wireless sensor networking;machine-2-machine communication;M2M communication;wireless bodyworn sensing device security;health infrastructure;medical applications;symmetric spatiotemporal characteristics;wireless link;link fingerprint matching;data session},   doi={10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457124},   ISSN={},   month={March},}
