abstract={Although an Internet-of-Things-based smart home solution can provide an improved and better approach to healthcare management, yet its end user adoption is very low. With elderly people as the main target, these conservative users pose a serious challenge to the successful implementation of smart home healthcare services. The objective of this research was to develop and test a theoretical framework empirically for determining the core factors that can affect the elderly users' acceptance of smart home services for healthcare. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted with 254 elderly people aged 55 years and above across four Asian countries. Partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the effect of eight hypothesized predicting constructs. The user perceptions were measured on a conceptual level rather than the actual usage intention toward a specific service. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, expert advice, and perceived trust have a positive impact on the behavioral intention. The same association is negative for technology anxiety and perceived cost. Facilitating conditions and social influence do not have any effect on the behavioral intention. The model could explain 81.4% of the total variance in the dependent variable i.e., behavioral intention. Effort expectancy is the leading predictor of smart homes for healthcare acceptance among the elderly. Together with expert advice, perceived trust, and perceived cost, these four factors represent the key influence of the elderly peoples' acceptance behavior. This paper provides the groundwork to explore the process of the actual adoption of smart home services for healthcare by the elderly people with potential future research areas.},

abstract={With an eye toward the reality that elderly persons face declining cognitive and physical capabilities as they advance in years, this paper proposes a handrail-shaped Internet of Things (IoT) sensor as a new type of sensing system to watch over seniors as they go about their daily lives. The system detects changes in mobility using movement velocity information and the degree of dependence the subject develops in relation to the handrail-IoT sensors. Herein, we describe a field experiment of our handrail sensor system that was installed in the home of an 88-year-old female test subject. The results show that the system worked well and unobtrusively in an actual home environment and could monitor behavioral changes over a long time period, thereby indicating that it can be used to detect abnormal statuses of other elderly residents via individualizing long-term monitoring programs.},

abstract={We propose smart home health care system for the realization of smart cities to fulfill the needs of elderly people in order to have continued care. An elderly person should be monitored constantly, specifically if he or she is diagnosed for health-related problems before. In the proposed system, a patient's condition is monitored by using multimodal inputs, specifically, speech and video. Video cameras and microphones are installed in the smart homes; these sensors constantly capture video and speech of the patient, and transmit them to a dedicated cloud. In the cloud, the data are processed, and a classification score on the patient's condition, whether he is normal, tensed, or in pain, is produced. Depending on the condition of the person, the doctors prescribe the person via audio, video or message services, or the caregivers rush to the location for emergency. For data processing in the server, we extract robust and low-dimensional discriminating features from voice and video frames. Experimental results show that the combined modality achieves better accuracy than that using a single modality to correctly classify the patient's condition.},

abstract={Smart homes have significant potential to enhance the lives of older adults, extending the period of healthy ageing, through monitoring wellbeing, detecting decline and applying interventions to prevent or slow down this decline. In this paper we present results from interviews with 7 older adults who have been living in smart homes for over 4 years. Our aims were to 1) examine attitudes to living with sensors and AAL technology over time; 2) gather opinions on the usefulness of this data for supporting self-management of health and wellbeing and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of various visualization techniques for presenting sensor-based health and wellness data. Our findings show that older adults are interested in receiving feedback from sensor technology to support them self-managing their wellbeing. Potential beneficial information includes time spent inside and outside the home, walking time, sleep, activity, blood pressure and weight. This information needs to be enhanced by education and goal-setting and by representing data using visualisations that are simple and intuitive.},

pages={563-568}, 
abstract={The ageing population worldwide is constantly rising, both in urban and regional areas. There is a need for IoT-based remote health monitoring systems that take care of the health of elderly people without compromising their convenience and preference of staying at home. However, such systems may generate large amounts of data. The key research challenge addressed in this paper is to efficiently transmit healthcare data within the limit of the existing network infrastructure, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we identified the key network requirements of a typical remote health monitoring system in terms of real-time event update, bandwidth requirements and data generation. Furthermore, we studied the network communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and HTTP to understand the needs of such a system, in particular the bandwidth requirements and the volume of generated data. Subsequently, we have proposed IReHMo - an IoT-based remote health monitoring architecture that efficiently delivers healthcare data to the servers. The CoAP-based IReHMo implementation helps to reduce up to 90% volume of generated data for a single sensor event and up to 56% required bandwidth for a healthcare scenario. Finally, we conducted a scalability analysis to determine the feasibility of deploying IReHMo in large numbers in regions of north Sweden.},

abstract={The healthcare system is in crisis due to challenges including escalating costs, the inconsistent provision of care, an aging population, and high burden of chronic disease related to health behaviors. Mitigating this crisis will require a major transformation of healthcare to be proactive, preventive, patient-centered, and evidence-based with a focus on improving quality-of-life. Information technology, networking, and biomedical engineering are likely to be essential in making this transformation possible with the help of advances, such as sensor technology, mobile computing, machine learning, etc. This paper has three themes: 1) motivation for a transformation of healthcare; 2) description of how information technology and engineering can support this transformation with the help of computational models; and 3) a technical overview of several research areas that illustrate the need for mathematical modeling approaches, ranging from sparse sampling to behavioral phenotyping and early detection. A key tenet of this paper concerns complementing prior work on patient-specific modeling and simulation by modeling neuropsychological, behavioral, and social phenomena. The resulting models, in combination with frequent or continuous measurements, are likely to be key components of health interventions to enhance health and wellbeing and the provision of healthcare.},

While these technologies offer significant benefits to older people and their families, they are also transforming older adults into lead adopters of a new 24/7 lifestyle of being monitored, managed, and, at times, motivated, to maintain their health and wellness. To better understand older adult perceptions of smart home technologies and to inform future research a workshop and focus group was conducted with 30 leaders in aging advocacy and aging services from 10 northeastern states. Participants expressed support of technological advance along with a variety of concerns that included usability, reliability, trust, privacy, stigma, accessibility and affordability. Participants also observed that there is a virtual absence of a comprehensive market and policy environment to support either the consumer or the diffusion of these technologies. Implications for research, policy and market innovation are discussed.},

abstract={Thailand has become an ageing society. The consequences of the situation appear to be an issue for health organizations to prepare efficient, safe and equitable health care for an aging population. Throughout the past decades, technology has been frequently utilized because it has provided new methods to support the facilitate health care services. In this paper, we studied the health situation of the elderly and proposed the Smart Healthcare system. It consists of a bio-signal measuring prototype (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) and a web application for both doctors and the elderly. It also includes an alert button. Evaluation was performed in two parts, which were qualitative interviewing and quantitative survey. We interviewed three doctors for confirmation regarding their opinion of the system (i.e. usefulness, visualizing data, and suggestions). Doctors replied that the system is useful for the elderly who are unaware of their own health information; consequently, they may unable to control their own health. For visualizing data, doctors normally view the measured data in number format. For displaying result to the elderly, it should be explained in simple statements that are easy to understand or described using color. Moreover, provision of an alert button is a valuable idea for saving lives. For the quantitative survey, we used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the core model to measure the acceptance by the elderly. Thirty 60-80-year-old elderly people participated in the survey. The result indicated that the elderly is perceived the usefulness of the system and were willing to use it unless they found it difficult to learn or understand because of possible negative attitudes toward new technologies.},

abstract={Home automation plays an important role in our daily life to control home appliances from a single touch or click. In this case, users are able to check home appliances from laptops, iPhone, iPod or other smart phone devices which supports to swap household appliances. Sensors are one of the mode important parts for smart home technology. Smart homes also help elderly people; they can handle the home with simplicity from their remote or smart device which is linked up to central device that is connected to home automation. Security is the main concern while maintains the smart homes, nowadays hackers don't need to travel to targeted homes, they can approach virtually to attack smart homes easily. In this paper, we propose a secure architecture for smart homes. We added a sicher firewall system between a central hub (LAN) that are linked to the cyberspace and other end that is connected to home appliances. In this way security threats become dejected and attackers are unable to reach home automation systems. A sicher firewall also protects system from internet threats. It generates a warning and protect system from external threats. Applying a sicher firewall, it enforces security system and increase security and concealment to smart homes. This experience will enhance user trustworthiness for using smart homes technology.},

pages={579-587}, 
abstract={Missing data is a common issue in community health and epidemiological studies. Direct removal of samples with missing data can lead to reduced sample size and information bias, which deteriorates the significance of the results. While data imputation methods are available to deal with missing data, they are limited in performance and could introduce noises into the dataset. Instead of data imputation, a novel method based on additive least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed in this paper for predictive modeling when the input features of the model contain missing data. The method also determines simultaneously the influence of the features with missing values on the classification accuracy using the fast leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The performance of the method is evaluated by applying it to predict the quality of life (QOL) of elderly people using health data collected in the community. The dataset involves demographics, socioeconomic status, health history, and the outcomes of health assessments of 444 community-dwelling elderly people, with 5% to 60% of data missing in some of the input features. The QOL is measured using a standard questionnaire of the World Health Organization. Results show that the proposed method outperforms four conventional methods for handling missing data-case deletion, feature deletion, mean imputation, and K-nearest neighbor imputation, with the average QOL prediction accuracy reaching 0.7418. It is potentially a promising technique for tackling missing data in community health research and other applications.},

abstract={Smart homes are no longer design concepts of the future. They are being built now, and they are having a direct impact on the lifestyles of people living in them. The aim of smart home systems is to create an environment that is aware of the activities taking place within it. Beside the healthy people, disabled people also need such systems to make their life easier, because they encounter with a lot of difficulties in their everyday life especially when they are at home. The solutions detailed in this paper offer health systems to be integrated with Smart Home services platforms to support home based e-care. Thus, the home e-health systems and architectures detailed in this paper will give a snapshot on the state of the art in the smart home technology for elders, people with disabilities, diabetes patients and people with schizophrenia. The focus of this research work is to supply a seamless personal care solution both from the biomedical data analysis, service provision, security guarantee and information managements point of view.},

abstract={The fraction of elderly people in the population has increased significantly in most developed countries in recent years. Embedded computing enables the deployment of Health Smart Homes that can enhance nurses or caregivers to assist patients in need of timely help, and the implementation of this application can be extremely easy and cheap when aided by Internet of Things technologies. In addition, there are few studies that take into account the patient's emotional state, which is crucial for them to be able to recover from a disease. This article discusses the use of images and emotional detection to assist patients and elderly people within an in-home healthcare context and sets out a model for the classification of emotions based on the facial expressions of the users. Finally, the results described in this article show that the Ensemble Classification that is put forward can achieve greater rates of accuracy, average of 82,53%, in classifying feelings than what can be obtained by using a single classifier.},

abstract={Over the last three decades, there has been a dramatic rise in ageing populations in most countries. Older people are remaining in nursing home care due to the fact that general services and medical support are provided. However, these costly environments often negatively affect older people due to high cost, limited staff and the social impacts they have. A way to overcome these challenges is to place the elderly instead in a smart home environment. The aim of this study is to describe the impact of wireless communications technologies on elderly people in a smart home. This has been compared with conditions in nursing homes. Using smart wireless sensors, wireless communications and ambient intelligent system, it is possible to create systems capable of measuring vital signs of the person in their own home. The findings indicate that wireless technology is the most suitable basis for a communications framework in a smart home to assist older people.},

abstract={E-health healthcare can enable patients to access health information and medical services ubiquitously. Most elderly people may have chronic disease, and about 80% even have two or more chronic conditions. Drug misuse leads to serious consequences even beings life-threatening. In this sense, how to design an e-health care system for the elderly is an important and interesting issue. Up to date, there are various APPs to friendly remind for taking medicine. However, for most APPs, patients should type in all medical information term by term personally. Via the information and communication technologies, we propose an e-health elderly care APP by using Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). Via using push notification from GCM, our e-health services provide the elderly with health information (e.g., prescription, medication instruction, taking-medicine time, reminding schedule back to the clinic, health nursing) through smartphone automatically after seeing a doctor.},

abstract={A rapidly ageing population requires support systems which would enable them to preserve dwellers' independence without compromising on their safety or their quality of life. Smart homes for the elderly have the potential to offer unobtrusive health and wellness monitoring. The aim is to provide a safe, independent living environment which can identify and predict problems by monitoring the activities of daily living (ADLs) of the inhabitants. For this, a system able to handle continuous streams of data is required. Such a system can extract the information by using appropriate classification and learning algorithms and thus allow the remote monitoring of health and wellbeing at a high level. The implementation requires: the use of appropriate sensing technologies, identification of ADLs, data pre-processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. This is challenging due to individual differences: such a system must be able to personalize individual needs. Our contribution was the design and implementation of a platform to smartly monitor health condition of elderly using sensor data from a smart home, through an interactive user interface which is user-friendly and multi-platform. This proof-of-concept used off-line data, with the view to extend to real-time data collection in the future, which could then be used to inform support providers remotely.},

Up to day, the localization is achieved by the door contacts and the volumetric sensors installed in each room of the HIS/sup 2/. The relationship is not trivial, consequently a set of rules, experienced during the installation of the HIS/sup 2/, has been elaborated. Thus, a set of rules has been written, with the limitation to only one person living in the home. Furthermore, we define the term "volume", more convenient than the term "room", as a room can include several volumes. Then we classify into three kinds of volumes: the "destination" volume, the "communication" volume and the "exchange" volume. This enables us to select the right sensor to be implemented with its best position inside the HIS/sup 2/.},

abstract={Various studies of assistive technology, embedded into the house for helping elderly persons have been introduced. There are many terms used to call this assistive technology, such as smart home, intelligent home, and home networking. The current technologies for smart home system can be divided into two basic categories: passive-intervention devices and active-intervention devices. Passive-intervention devices monitor an elderly person's condition and safety without intervening in his or her care, such as detecting heart rate, respiration, and restlessness by using electrode-slipping device, inserted under mattress pads. Active-intervention devices play more active role in an elderly person care, such as all sensors equipped with alarms, reminder systems, and medication administration system. The smart home technologies enhance a quality of living and allow the elderly to live independently in their homes, while their adult children are working. A successful promotion of smart home technologies does not depend only on the intelligence itself, but it also requires needs, concerns, perceptions, and psychological accessibilities for elderly persons. This paper proposes the smart home model for the elderly in Thailand, based on the stakeholders' requirements, concerns, and perceptions. By given the selected technologies in passiveintervention devices and active-intervention devices, this paper shows the perceptions, psychological accessibility factors, needs, and concerns of specific smart home model for elderly care, using a questionnaire and survey. The interpreting of the results of statistical analysis relies on both qualitative and quantitative methods, therefore the smart home model for the elderly in Thailand can be designed and implemented, practically based on the stakeholders' perspectives.},

In this paper we present the technical aspects and rationale behind systems that can use emotional valence monitoring to quantify prolonged emotional negativity and identify the activities associated with such negativity.

abstract={Telemedicine and Telemonitoring of elderly people is an actual challenge that is explored to prevent some problems linked to the constant growing of the mean age of the population. It requires to recognize the behavior and the actions of a person inside his own home with non-intrusive sensors and to process data to check the evolution of the person. Activities of Daily Living can be learned and automatically recognized using supervised classification on sensor data. This paper presents the results of the study of prior introduction, in Support Vector Machine, to improve this automatic recognition of Activities of Daily Living. We started from a set of data acquired in daily life during an experimentation in the Health Smart Home of the TIMC-IMAG Lab. From this restricted set of data, we obtained models for seven activities of Daily Living and test, with leave-one-out method, the performance of this classification. This first step gave baseline results that this paper tends to improve using consistent priors to compute more specific and accurate models of the different activities that are learned and obtain better results on the leave-one-out method on the sensors data.},

abstract={Smart home has become a visible concept that attracts the collaboration of various areas of science and engineering. Increasing the power efficiency and power management has become an important research topic since a decade. In this research article, the focus is to ease the life of elder and handicapped people. In point of fact as compare to the healthy people, elderly and disabled people experiences difficulties to perform their everyday activities. Elderly and disabled people can be supported by using smart homes by providing them secure, safe, and controlled environments. The developed system allows the users to be able to control the appliances with least physical efforts. More particularly, the designed system allow users to switch the home appliances ON and OFF just by sending message command by using Android application or SMS with the help of a cell phone. Not only the far remote monitoring, but the local management of appliances is made possible by using the Bluetooth technology. The experimental results demonstrate that the user can control the home appliances with the designed Android application by using the voice, Bluetooth, and SMS inputs.},

abstract={Population ageing presents big challenge for cities, which will have to support increasing number of elderly citizens with special social and health needs. New services based on integrated care, community approach and modern technologies can help to face this challenge. Use of ICT-based solutions can enable new ways of indicating, delivering and managing care and help increasing senior citizens' quality of life. Therefore, innovation in elderly care should be part of Smart city agenda. But out of all topics linked to Smart cities, elderly care is maybe the most resistant when it comes to implementing new technology. The article discusses the obstacles in innovation in integrated elderly care and presents participative design methods as possible catalysator of change. The case study from the City of Prague demonstrates the use of participatory design in designing complex ICT based solution for integrated elderly home care in major European city. The article summarizes what stakeholders were involved in the project, what methods were used and how participatory design contributed to the final solutions and their acceptance.},

abstract={The average age of the world's population is increasing, and life expectancy will increase by an extra 10 years by the year 2050. The growing number of older adults increases the demands on public health systems and the related care costs. The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support integrated healthcare services in elderly homecare can make an important contribution to reducing such costs. The SOCIALIZE AAL project aims to create a new reference platform for the elderly by applying technological solutions to simplify their daily activities and the means by which they access dedicated services in order to improve their quality of life. This paper describes the Elderly Monitoring service - an IoT module of the SOCIALIZE platform, whose aim is to collect environmental and physical user data so that they can be supervised by medical and caregiver staffs. The system has been designed to enable easy addition and/or substitution of new services and devices within the environment. To this end, the service implements a framework that enables heterogeneous devices belonging to different domotic systems and protocols to directly share data, thereby implementing an infrastructure suitable for the fulfillment of a real Social IoT (SIoT).},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies create intelligent systems to assist the aging population for a healthier and safer life in their living environment. Such systems usually offer context-aware, personalized and adaptive services. However, these kinds of systems make extensive and intensive use of personal data, which makes privacy protection a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a framework for privacy modeling computation and management for AAL within Smart Homes. We analyze the privacy features in the smart home that affect the privacy of the users. Based on these features a metric is developed to compute the sensitivity of the collected information and consequently the potential privacy risk. A simple implementation of the proposed framework is then applied to a real world smart home living environment at Great Northern Haven, in which data were collected and the framework was evaluated. This study offers an effective and practical approach to evaluate the privacy risk of users and proposes a metric that can be used for access control and recommendation of privacy settings to the users of the AAL environments.},

abstract={The health integrated smart home information system (HIS2) has been developed in the TIMC laboratory for the remote monitoring of the health status of the elderly at home. This aims at improving patients' living conditions and at avoiding the costs of the long hospitalization. The design of this system is based on a CAN network linked to volumetric, physiological and environment sensors. Collaboration between the TIMC and the CLIPS laboratories permitted us to replace the video camera, unacceptable to patients for obvious privacy reasons, with a system based on multichannel sound acquisition. The coupling of both systems will enable them to detect if a person is in distress or not. Both systems locally process in real time the incoming data and communicate using a CAN network to display the health status. This article describes briefly the architecture of both systems, practical solutions for their communication, and their data fusion which is the beginning of a new step in the health smart homes domain.},

This paper introduces emergency service for a Smart Home System (SHS) based on Ethereum blockchain with smart contract for decentralized handling access control among untrusted public services so called Home Service Providers (HSPs) and smart home IoT devices. Our SHS testbed consists of (1) smart home sensor manger equipped with Raspberry Pi (RPi) represented as an edge IoT gateway for gathering environmental sensor data, (2) HSP miners deployed Meteor and Ethereum platform, and (3) web-based applications for home users and HSP staffs. Furthermore, our contribution includes the integration of digital signature for the IoT device authentication, the One Time Passcode with QR code for HSP staff access control, and IPFS for manipulating emergency call from SHS in peers. Our implementation results focusing on HSP miners will be presented and analysed.},

abstract={Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94% ± 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75% ± 0.8.},

abstract={By 2050, about one third of the French population will be over 65. Our laboratory's current research focuses on the monitoring of elderly people at home, to detect a loss of autonomy as early as possible. Our aim is to quantify criteria such as the international activities of daily living (ADL) or the French Autonomie Gerontologie Groupes Iso-Ressources (AGGIR) scales, by automatically classifying the different ADL performed by the subject during the day. A Health Smart Home is used for this. Our Health Smart Home includes, in a real flat, infrared presence sensors (location), door contacts (to control the use of some facilities), temperature and hygrometry sensor in the bathroom, and microphones (sound classification and speech recognition). A wearable kinematic sensor also informs postural transitions (using pattern recognition) and walk periods (frequency analysis). This data collected from the various sensors are then used to classify each temporal frame into one of the ADL that was previously acquired (seven activities: hygiene, toilet use, eating, resting, sleeping, communication, and dressing/undressing). This is done using support vector machines. We performed a 1-h experimentation with 13 young and healthy subjects to determine the models of the different activities, and then we tested the classification algorithm (cross validation) with real data.},

abstract={There has been a rapid growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart-homes recently. Although these IoT powered smart-homes offer new opportunities, their household penetration is quite low. The main objective of this paper is to develop a better understanding of the reasons underlying the end-user resistance to the adoption of the IoT enabled smart-homes, with elderly people as the target population. Due to a rapid increase in the worldwide elderly population, various forms of information and communication technology (ICT) services are used for their well-being, and hence the target of this paper. A very few research has focused on the end-user experience of using smart-homes with all of them using an acceptance-based approach. Using different negative-perception modeling, we try to identify the main barriers to smart-home usage by the elderly people. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted with 254 elderly people across four Asian countries. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test our theoretical model having ten constructs. Two constructs (perceived-uselessness and self-efficacy) were found to be non-significant, while the remaining proved to be significant (innovativeness, perceived-reliability, perceived-interoperability, service-cost, privacy-concern, psychological-barrier, home administrative policy, and government-policy). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research studying the IoT enabled smart-homes using a resistive approach and should provide the groundwork for further research in user-experience studies with IoT technology.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is the prelude to new technological innovation. It expands with different applications such as smart home, smart city, smart grids, smart car, smart healthcare and smart retail. The application of IoT in Healthcare system brings high value for the elderly, victims of chronic disease and those who require constant supervision. But there are many security issues in such application. Moreover, the medical devices used in the IoT enabled Healthcare System are resource constrained devices. So, this paper proposes a novel mechanism for authenticating such resource constrained medical devices. New algorithm for secure authentication and key agreement of the medical devices is also presented. This mechanism is resistance against various security attacks such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle and Denial of Service attacks. Formal security analysis and the comparative study presented in this paper have proved that the proposed mechanism has many security features and highly secure among the already existing authentication mechanisms.},

A lot of research is currently going on in providing these elderly people with a smart environment or smart home that can promote their independence, overall sense of well-being and enable them to lead a better quality of life. The primary objective of this research paper is to provide with a concise systematic review that explores the influence these smart-homes can have on the living quality among the elderly. We identified a total of 4,512 initial publications related to smart-homes for the elderly across a variety of valid scientific databases. Out of these, 31 met our inclusion criterion to be included for the final review stage by 2 independent researchers. Depending upon the functionality we classify the smart-homes into 5 broad application areas that can serve the elderly. Our findings show that overall these elderly people have a positive attitude towards a smart-home, especially for the purpose of health-monitoring and independent assisted living. However, they also have serious concerns regarding their privacy and the security provided by such smart systems along with the fear of social-isolation that might happen due to an increased dependence on technology.},

abstract={By increasing intelligence in health services, people's quality of life will improve and access to emergency medical services and care for patients and elderly will be faster and easier. Internet of Things (IoT) services can provide health care to a new generation of skilled services that are highly acclaimed. However, there are challenges in this area. One of these challenges includes assurance quality of service (QoS) due to the high volume of information. The existence of programs that produce a large amount of real-time data in terms of velocity and variety has turned this into a big data problem. To overcome these challenges, the researchers recommend the integration of the cloud and the Internet of Things. Due to this, the patient monitoring system is supported by the recent developments mainly by cloud computing and the IoT paradigms, so the integration of the two paradigm contributes significantly to the provision of more quality of services. This paper presents the characteristics of the cloud and the Internet of Things paradigms, which are used in remote healthcare. In addition, to provide smart health services with the best quality, we need to use cloud and IoT integration services, which is definitely one of the challenges of this area. Therefore, in this paper, first, the challenges of quality of service are expressed in the integration of the cloud and the Internet of Things services. Then, the challenges of QoS in smart healthcare services such as the limitation of use of sensor data, big data, lack of standard methods of quality of service and the complexity of cloud and IoT layers are reviewed based on this integration. Finally, a method for maintaining the quality of service in providing smart healthcare services is proposed.},

abstract={The percentage of the elderly population has been on rise steadily over the past few years across the globe, which is a cause of serious concern among the research fraternity. A lot of research is going on that tries to harness the benefits of the various information and communication technologies to enable these elderly people to live independently and promote a sense of overall well-being. Although in the evolutionary phase, yet smart homes can help these elderly people in their daily life. However, for the success of such smart systems, the intention of the users towards using those systems must be understood. But, there is a serious lack of relevant exploratory research that tries to measure and explain the adoption of such smart homes by the elderly population from a multiple theory perspective: namely, the technology acceptance model, the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior. The main aim of this paper is to fill up this void of a lack of theoretical approach by testing the three models in the context of the adoption of smart homes by the elderly population. In order to do so, we conducted a survey with N = 239 (after screening) and analyzed the results using the structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis techniques. Results suggest that all the three models are valid although they do not take into account certain factors that are unique to this context. This paper paper provides the initial groundwork to explore the process of adopting smart home services by the elderly with potential future research areas.},

abstract={Now days, the home environment is still much less supportive of life for the elderly, most elderly living at home need a companion to help them. Safety, health, happiness and independence will be difficult for them to get even the elderly will be further away from the surrounding environment. Based on population projection 2017 data there are 23.66 million elderly people in Indonesia and predicted in 2020 there are 27.08 million people elderly. Smart homes that are currently widely studied have not focused on elderly; most smart homes only provide a sense of security and convenience for adult residents. And this will be a problem that until now has not solved the improvement of human life through technology to get happiness, care and health especially for the elderly. In many cases of the elderly, it is easier to send them to live in a nursing home and that keeps them separated from their families for the rest of their lives. That's what makes them less happiness. Orange Technology is a collection of technological elements to improve human life by getting happiness, Care and health. This study reviewed the journals of scientific databases such as IEEE explore, ACM digital library and Proquest published from 2002 to 2017. From the search results obtained 54 papers that will answer the scientific questions of this research. The result of this research is a framework of smart house that has Sensor, Monitoring, Wireless, Scalability, Low cost, GPS and ease of installation and maintenance as components of smart house of orange technology for elderly.},

abstract={We endeavor to provide a novel tool to evaluate environmental comfort level in health smart home (HSH). HSH is regarded a good alternative for the independent life of elders and people with disability. Numerous intelligent devices, installed within a home environment, can provide the resident with continuous monitoring and comfortable environment. In this paper, a novel method of evaluating environmental comfort level is provided. An intelligent sensor is a fuzzy comfort sensor that can measure and fusion the environmental parameters. Based upon the results, it will further give a linguistic description about the environmental comfort level, in the manner of an expert system. The core of the sensor is multi-parameter information fusion. Similar to human behavior, the sensor makes all the evaluation about the surrounding environment's comfort level based on the symbolic measurement theory. We applied chart representation theory in multivariate analysis in the biomedical engineering field to complete the human comfortable sensor's linguistic concept creation. We achieved better performance when using this method to complete multi-parameter fusion and fuzziness. It is our belief that this method can be used in both biology intelligent sensing and many other areas, where the quantitative and qualitative information transform is needed},

The statistics shows that there is increasing number of elderly people around the world and this isn't going to change. In developing contries like India, because of growing busy life style, many elderly people are being forced to live alone or put in a rest home or other sheltered living arrangement by their children. Causing the elderly vulnerable and losing their independence. We developed a smart-system consists of optimum number of wireless sensors that includes current, bed, and water flow sensors. The sensors provide information that can be used for monitoring elderly by detecting abnormality pattern in their active daily life. The system will generate early warning message to care giver, when an unforeseen abnormal condition occurs. It will also, analyze the gathered data to determine residents behaviour. Instead of using many number of sensors, the importance of positioning the optimal number of intelligent sensors close to the source of a potential problem phenomenon, where the acquired data provide the greatest benefit or impact has been discussed.},

abstract={Smart cities face the challenge of combining sustainable national welfare with high living standards. In the last decades, life expectancy increased globally, leading to various age-related issues in almost all developed countries. Frailty affects elderly who are experiencing daily life limitations due to cognitive and functional impairments and represents a remarkable burden for national health systems. In this paper, we proposed two different predictive models for frailty by exploiting 12 socioclinical databases. Emergency hospitalization or all-cause mortality within a year were used as surrogates of frailty. The first model was able to assign a frailty risk score to each subject older than 65 years old, identifying five different classes for tailor made interventions. The second prediction model assigned a worsening risk score to each subject in the first nonfrail class, namely the probability to move in a higher frailty class within the year. We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the whole elderly population of the Municipality of Bologna, Italy. We created a baseline cohort of 95 368 subjects for the frailty risk model and a baseline cohort of 58 789 subjects for the worsening risk model, respectively. To evaluate the predictive ability of our models through calibration and discrimination estimates, we used, respectively, a six-year and a four-year observation period. Good discriminatory power and calibration were obtained, demonstrating a good predictive ability of the models.},

abstract={Smart cities and smart homes are driving economic growth and improving the quality of people's life by enabling local development and harnessing technologies, especially the ones leading to smart outcomes and connectivity. Application of smart solutions will enable human living environments to use technology, information and data to improve infrastructures and services in the behalf of human beings. The welfare of elderly people living alone, at their homes, or, in rest houses, can significantly be improved with the introduction of these smart solutions. Wireless indoor tracking of elderly people is an important feature together with the DLMS/COSEM protocol. Above all using low power devices to assist and monitoring them. The paper highlights implementation in the real world, proposing a method that can be suited in a large range of cases thanks to the scene analysis. An indoor scalable infrastructure allows the tracking method to be implemented incrementally with different performances, where optimal accuracy comes from an adaptable threshold. The method has been tested in different environments using both simulations and direct measurements. Result from the proposed method are compared with the KNN method.},

Detecting the appearance of wandering behaviours in the elderly population is crucial in order to tackle the early treatment of mild cognitive impairments. To that end, a number of proposals have appeared, either theoretical methods or practical applications. This paper addresses the assessment of wandering detection methods from different perspectives. First, we review the available datasets in the literature that can be used for benchmarking wandering detection methods. Moreover, we analyse the available datasets using a well-known wandering detection technique, so as to obtain the number of abnormal trajectories with respect to the whole dataset and each individual. Finally, we discuss the properties that a dataset for benchmarking should fulfil.},

In order to meet these requirements, smart home of today should support a number of functionalities. One such functionality of a smart home environment is the location detection. In this work, we propose a voice based location detection system which can be integrated in a smart home environment. Our location detection system uses Amazon Echo as the voice interface and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect location of specific patients. The proposed location detection will be suitable for large scale application where we may need to keep track of multiple patients. Moreover, the inclusion of voice enabled feature to this system will reduce the burden of learning curve of new technologies on family and caregivers thereby improving the quality of life.},

abstract={Elderly people who are staying alone require some form of assistance since they might forget minor things which could lead to a major security threats. Aged people can easily get sick and if they are alone at these situations they cannot get help in time. This project proposes a Wireless Sensor Network based smart home monitoring system for such elderly people to monitor their health and provide them with a safe and secure living. The Wireless Sensor Network deploys various sensors to identify the occurrence of specific events. By placing wearable sensors on the waist of the person, the sensor values are computed and assessed. Temperature, Heartbeat and Pressure sensors are used to determine the health parameters of the person. The contact sensors are used to determine if a door is open or not. The fall detection system consisting of an inertial unit includes a tri-axial accelerometer and a gyroscope for efficient data fusion. The fall detection algorithm is used to monitor the activities of the elderly people and determine whether or not a fall has occurred.

abstract={Health services delivery relating to chronic diseases in elders are becoming a hot spot with the progressively severity in population aging in China. To provide a better service system for the elders, researchers have used active rule based techniques including Event-Condition-Active (ECA). In this paper, we enhanced ECA to ECA-Sequence (ECA-S) rules to detect abnormal condition in physiological indices. Our method extracts accurate health information from historical sequence data. The ECA-S is used to differentiate burst variations in physiological indices from morbid cases. Our further experiment in giving early warning for diabetic patients shows that ECA-S can deal with the burst abnormal physiological index problem. Finally, an evaluation is made among existing ECA based solutions including prime ECA, ECA-Parameters, ECA-Post-condition and proved that our proposed ECA-S method performs better in health diagnosis quality as compared to others.},

year={2010}, 
volume={},

pages={1-8}, 
abstract={Recognition of inhabitants' activities of daily living (ADLs) is an important task in smart homes to support assisted living for elderly people aging in place. However, uncertain information brings challenge to activity recognition which can be categorised into environmental uncertainties from sensor readings and user uncertainties of variations in the ways to carry out activities in different contexts, or by different users within the same environment. To address the challenges of these two types of uncertainty, in this paper, we introduce the innovative idea of incorporating activity duration into the framework of learning inhabitants' behaviour patterns on carrying out ADLs in smart home environment. A probabilistic learning algorithm is proposed with duration information in the context of multi-inhabitants in a single home environment. The prediction is for both inhabitant and ADL using the learned model representing what activity is carried out and who performed it. Experiments are designed for the evaluation of duration information in identifying activities and inhabitants. Real data have been collected in a smart kitchen laboratory, and realistic synthetic data are generated for evaluation. Evaluations show encouraging results for higher-level activity identification and improvement on inhabitant and activity prediction in the challenging situation of incomplete observation due to unreliable sensors compared to models that are derived with no duration information. The approach also provides a potential opportunity to identify inhabitants' concept drift in long-term monitoring and respond to a deteriorating situation at as early stage as possible.},

abstract={Gait monitoring technology has recently become of increasing interest in the biometric as well as biomedical fields for observation of the human movement, especially walking that can refer to physical status of individuals. For this objective, data shoes own many advantages such as cheaper cost and rich of direct information from the walking. In this paper, we have developed a data shoe system for gait monitoring in home area. To observe gait behaviors, the sensor suite includes five force sensitive resistors (FSRs) which were installed on the insole of the shoe. Zigbee wireless communication technology was used as low-cost data transfer between the sensor suite and the receiver system which is USB-connected to a computer. The summary of the gait data can be submitted and displayed on social media such as Facebook in order that relatives or care-takers can monitor the wearer closely. Principal component analysis (PCA) pattern recognition of the experimental data has shown that this system can classify normal and abnormal walking patterns in a group of elderly volunteers. The integration of sensors, wireless technology and social ability with computer software could make the social data shoe system monitor the gait behaviors during the wearing time.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Nowadays many users can be involved willingly and monitored in a more or less intrusive manner with data collected in their homes. This data can be collected from mobile and wearable devices (such as smart phone and smart watch), from sensors disseminated in the home (such as motion detectors and contact switches) and from self-reported information systems (using paper based or web-based ecological momentary assessment techniques). This data can then be useful to characterize the activity, the health and the well-being of the involved person. Enabling people suffering (such as elderly people, people with physical disabilities and people with mental-health condition) to stay in their home as long as possible in good condition is an important challenge for many countries. Firstly, most of people would rather to continue to live in their own home rather than move to a nursing-home or an hospital, secondly the solutions enabling staying at home are also usually cheaper for the society. As a consequence Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living (SHAAL) systems gain more and more attention. SHAAL systems use information and communication technologies in a person's daily living environment to enable them to stay active longer, remain socially connected and live independently. SHAAL's research covers a wide range of topics. This talk will review the main aspects of SHAAL systems from the data mining point of view. Several case studies will be illustrated. In particular it will emphasize the key role of activity learning and behavior understanding.},

abstract={The growth of the world's population and the dramatic increase in average life expectancy raise awareness of the global burden of elderly diseases. Mild cognitive impairments affect elderly people, which suffer a deterioration of their capabilities, with special regard to memory. Such problems often lead to disorientation or wandering: erratic movements and changes in mobility and behavioural patterns. In this context, an early and automatic detection of wandering symptoms avoids risks and possible damages to these patients, improving their quality of life. However, wandering detection is not trivial, because several factors such as patterns, environment or the severity of the dementia need to be considered. The research community has proposed several techniques, algorithms and technologies in order to properly detect such abnormal behaviours. Moreover, the new health paradigm, Smart Health, opens the door to a new generation of systems and technologies in order to overcome the shortcomings of the classical methods in this field of research. This paper analyses the most relevant wandering detection methods present in the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={The empty nest syndrome has become a significant modern social problem. Recent research has enhanced physical health monitoring for the elderly in smart home environment. However, the social needs of the empty nesters have been less supported in smart home designs. A compelling story about the elderly can make the adult children emotionally attached to their elderly parents and establish a healthy social connection between them. In this work, we propose a data-driven story generation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT based techniques enable the real time collection of the elderly's environment data through various sensors located in the home. The story generation system can weave the information mined from the sensor data into a story with high persuasive and emotion arousing power. Our system automatically collects raw sensor data on the cloud server and maps them to values of semantically meaningful context variables through activity functions. A director agent organizes the story plot with a Goal Net based approach and dynamically generates storylines based on a set of scene selection rules. The proposed system is carefully studied with a simulated smart home environment.},

abstract={Today elderly people are the fastest growing segment of the population in developed countries, and they desire to live as independently as possible. But independent lifestyles come with risks and challenges. Medical in-home telemonitoring (and, more generally, telemedicine) is a solution to deal with these challenges and to ensure that elderly people can live safely and independently in their own homes for as long as possible. In this context we propose an automatic in-home healthcare monitoring system for several uses and to meet the needs identified above. The proposed telemonitoring system is a multimodal platform with several sensors that can be installed at home and enables us to have a full and tightly controlled universe of data sets. It integrates elderly physiological and behavioral data, the acoustical environment of the elderly, environmental conditions and medical knowledge. Each modality is processed and analyzed by specific algorithms. A data fusion approach based on fuzzy logic with a set of rules directed by medical recommendations, is used to fuse the various subsystem outputs. This multimodal fusion increases the reliability of the whole system by detecting several distress situations. In fact this fusion approach takes into account temporary sensor malfunction and increases the system reliability and the robustness in the case of environmental disturbances or material limits (Battery, RF range, etc.). The Fuzzy logic fusion methods brings high flexibility to the telemonitoring platform especially in combining modalities or adding other sensors. The proposed telemonitoring system will ensure pervasive in-home health monitoring for elderly people.},

abstract={Two of the grand challenges in engineering are concerned with water and healthcare. The challenge related to water is especially critical because water is a vital and necessary resource for all humans. However, chemicals and bacteria in drinking water pose significant health risks for us. To improve the safety of drinking water, sensitive, low-cost, rapid detection methods are required for water quality monitoring. These sensors must also be precise, reliable, easy-to-use, and of small dimensions. For monitoring the quality of drinking water, the two most critical parameters are pH and chlorine. In the first part of the presentation, we describe our work on developing small-size, flexible, easy-to-use, and low-cost pH and chlorine sensors that are also very sensitive and reliable. We also describe our on-going work to optimize the physical structures and manufacturing conditions for miniaturized sensing devices that are integrated with preprocessing modules and electronics towards smart sensors. In the second challenge related to healthcare, the situation is compounded by the fact that over the past century, we have seen a continual increase in life expectancy primarily due to improvements in public health, nutrition, medicine and personal hygiene. However, this phenomenal success is now coupled with aging population demographics and falling birth rates. In fact, never before in human history have we been confronted with such a large aging population, nor have we developed solid, cost-effective solutions for the healthcare, social needs and well-being of the elderly. Here, we describe our work in which we use advances in information technology, wireless communication, web-based technologies and autonomics, to develop new, smart and cost-effective solutions for the health wellness of the elderly. Such solutions would enable elderly to lead independent lifestyles in their own homes while being non-invasively, non-intrusively and seamlessly monitored for the early detection of symptoms, so diseases can be treated earlier than in later stages as is currently done; to promote health wellness; as well as to treat chronic illnesses. Through a few examples related to walking, sleeping and vital signs sensing, we will describe our ongoing work as well as the challenges we have uncovered. In particular, we will focus on the critical role of information technology (IT) in developing innovative, low-cost and high impacting solutions to the pending elderly demographic crisis in a smart home. Finally, we will describe the role of the practical solutions being developed for these two grand engineering challenges and their impact in the evolution of smart cities.},

abstract={The ability to accurately recognize daily activities of residents is a core premise of smart homes to assist with remote health monitoring. Most of the existing methods rely on a supervised model trained from a preselected and manually labeled set of activities, which are often time-consuming and costly to obtain in practice. In contrast, this paper presents an unsupervised method for discovering daily routines and activities for smart home residents. Our proposed method first uses a Markov chain to model a resident's locomotion patterns at different times of day and discover clusters of daily routines at the macro level. For each routine cluster, it then drills down to further discover room-level activities at the micro level. The automatic identification of daily routines and activities is useful for understanding indicators of functional decline of elderly people and suggesting timely interventions.},

abstract={The recent development of big data-oriented wireless technologies in terms of emerging 5G, edge computing, interconnected devices of the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics, as well as techniques, have enabled connected healthcare services for a happier and healthier life. Although, the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services toward 5G.},

abstract={Many people with incapacities can continue lives in their existing home with the application of an assistive informatics and healthcare monitoring. Elderly's ability to perform daily activities presents the elderly's wellness. Investigation of human activities for extracting health and well-being statistics is one of the present challenges given the Smart Aging. The existing research works are mostly focusing on offline monitoring and do not give significance to real-time monitoring and forecasting. This paper aims to apply lifestyle monitoring and forecasting in real time in ambient assisted living (AAL) system with diagnosing the conduct and distinguishing the variation from the norm with the slightest conceivable fake alert. Anomaly forecasting model based on inactivity and activity of period of the different ADL is formulated. The present study demonstrates the novel approach for forecasting of wellness anomaly related to the activity of daily living (ADL). The significant correlation between lifestyle and health status is established. Through the present research forecasting of lifestyle would facilitate remote physician/caregiver to insight symptom of the disease and provide health improvement advises to the resident. Moreover, if it is a life-threatening degradation in wellness index than appropriate service provider would be informed directly.},

abstract={With the more and more serious population aging problem, the demand of long-term care is increasing. Actually, most of the aging people have the ability to take care of themselves, some warm concerns, medical advices, and timely remainders can effectively improve their living quality. Therefore, an automatic system to track and record elderly people's daily life and activities is required. In this paper, we propose a Long-term cArE-based Smart hOme platform (LAESO), which integrates the cloud, IoT, sensor networks, and community. The proposed LAESO platform combines with a variety of services, such as motion detection, activity detection and log, e-Care, indoor positioning, location-based real-time video monitoring, emergency notification, and lost elderly searching. Detected motions and activities of the elderly will be logged on to the cloud platform. With the log, e-Care can produce graphics and charts by doing statistics. Accordingly, family members and caregivers are able to understand the daily life and activity changes of the elderly. Moreover, we integrate the particle filter and 9-axis sensor to provide indoor positioning. LAESO platform also develops the emergency notification and location-based real-time video monitoring services to handle emergency events, i.e., the elderly falls down. Finally, we propose a novel lost elderly searching method, which combines the GPS positioning and crowd sensing to help find the missing elderly. Our real prototyping experience and some experimental results are also reported.},

A health smart home is used to achieve this goal. This flat includes different sensors. The data from the various sensors were used to classify each temporal frame into one of the activities of daily living that has been previously learnt (seven activities: hygiene, toilets, eating, resting, sleeping, communication and dressing/undressing). This is done using support vector machines.

However, when thinking about healthy older adults, there are two important points to take into account for the smart home: providing comfort and monitoring the position inside the house of the older adults on their daily life. This can also help their families giving them peace of mind. In this study, we designed a smart home system which includes low-cost sensor parts and a finger robot. This system can be used to control home appliances, such as air conditioners to keep the residents in a comfortable environment. Without the need of additional sensors only by using CO2 sensors, this system can provide information such as the room the resident is in, or if he/she is at home or not. As a result, we show a working system and the CO2 sensor is able to judge the position of the resident, and we are even able to understand the movement path of the resident.},

abstract={China, like many other developed and developing countries in the world, is facing a rapid ageing population. This phenomenon has led to profound impacts on China's national health and welfare system, social stability, economic development, and productivity, and so is forcing the country to adopt new innovative, resourceful and reliable means to offer better health and caring services to the elderly people. Wearable technologies have the potential to aid this struggle, but there is currently very limited understanding on Chinese old people's requirements for using these technologies. Such misunderstanding can lead to severe mismatch between wearable functions and actual user needs, and so minimize the potential and usefulness of wearable technologies. Therefore, this paper aims to address this knowledge gap by reporting on an exploratory study that investigated Chinese older people's user requirements towards wearable healthcare devices. Five focus groups were conducted to collect insights and opinions respectively from five Chinese families. Each family participated in the focus group contained at least 1-2 elderly member, together with 2-4 family members who held caring responsibilities. The thematic analysis approach was used to analyse the collected qualitative data. The results showed that user requirements of Chinese elderly people contained three main categories, namely healthcare, data privacy and security, and commodity and entertainment needs. The paper concluded that these identified user requirements should be carefully considered by wearable hardware designers, system developers, and service providers if they want their innovative products and services to be accepted by the intended users in the Chinese market.},

abstract={The Portuguese census of 2011 showed that 22,5% of the population of Região Centro was 65 years old or more. The increase in the elderly population leads to the need to promote healthy aging, with autonomy and independence, and preserving the functional capacity. As people get older, injuries and health conditions that impact on their wellbeing must be taken into account, and understanding what is adequate requires specialized knowledge and training. If people are left alone deciding their own activity level, they can be too aggressive and aggravate their injuries, create new ones and refrain themselves in exercising more, or too conservative and in the long run they will have an activity level under their potential and below what is recommended. In this paper we present SmartWalk, a project that aims to create a monitoring system of wellbeing and physical activity in the context of Smart Cities. The project is more than a smartphone application, as it will have health professionals operating the system and will take into consideration contextual and user specific information.

abstract={There is a trend towards the development of sensor systems to help older people improve their safety in the home environment. This is due to an increase in the average age of the population, together with a greater focus on providing non-hospital health care services, and greater availability of low-cost components to support such systems. It is expected that smart home care technologies would be potentially useful in monitoring the safety of the elderly in the home environment. The safety of older and disabled people can be continuously monitored without interrupting their daily routine with intelligent devices and modern sensors located in their home environment and on the body. While home care technologies are beneficial for older people, and encourage independence, there are still privacy and safety issue that need to be considered if such systems are to be widely adopted. Further research is required, especially with respect to regarding use cases and the cost implications of home-based systems.},

abstract={Cities increasingly face challenges related to pollution, efficient use of resources (e.g. water, energy) and ensuring a good quality of life for its citizens. Solutions built on existing and emerging technologies such as Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine and data analytics can improve on or create services able to address these challenges. These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City. Furthermore the question is raised if insights into a South African Smart City can strengthen European initiatives. A need for inter-continental automated testing facilities such as those developed by TRESCIMO is identified through which integrated experiments can be conducted to provide insight and answers.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today's Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.},

The device is capable of detecting sudden fall situations, cardiac abnormalities & hyper/hypotension; thereby rendering it suitable for real-time monitoring, self-diagnosis and remote diagnosis purposes. The system is also capable of sending notifications to healthcare professionals immediately after the detection of any of the aforementioned health abnormalities so that the necessary steps are taken. The complete analysis and evaluation of the signals acquired from the patient have been performed using a software platform: NI LabVIEW.

It allows for improvements in the way we live or work, and for improved energy efficiencies. The smart home is especially relevant for the elderly because the intelligent sensing systems would allow for remote monitoring and possibly control of health and environmental parameters according to their health status and living needs. The burgeoning elderly population and rising costs of elderly healthcare and home needs have led to a rapid evolution of the elderly smart living environment. However, the lack of proper eldercare smart home technologies has inspired us to develop Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) based smart home for the elderly using the Android platform. We have proposed a model for the elderly using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) implemented as an Android application. Our smart home research potentially allows the elderly to continue to live in their own homes while being monitored non-invasively, seamlessly and economically according to their healthcare needs and status.},

abstract={The first cohort of “baby boomers” are now 65 years or older, presaging a massive wave of aging “boomers” that could degrade health care and elder care over the next quarter-century. Cost-effective, high-impact technologies for aging, disabilities and independent living are urgently needed. In this paper, we present our experience in building “assistive environments” for older adults-the Gator Tech Smart House (GTSH) project. Numerous R&D efforts similar to ours are either underway or have recently been conducted. In most of these projects, prototypes have been built to achieve independence, well being, and in general, good quality of life. But prototyping a technology is one thing; commercial proliferation and creating a vibrant industry around such technology is an altogether different proposition. From the lessons learned in the GTSH, we analyze the impediments hindering the emergence of products and services for assistive environments, and present the blueprints of an ecosystem based on requirements drawn from the lessons learned. We believe the proposed ecosystem is an important beginning to providing better conditions for an accelerated proliferation of next-generation smart homes and assistive environments.},

abstract={Ambient Intelligence is a new paradigm in information technology to empower people. Such a paradigm that highlights human interaction with machines makes smart technologies a good candidate for development of various real-life solutions in the field of health care, including human activity recognition in smart homes. Since the description of user activity plays an important role in a smart environment, recognition and tracking user activities of daily living can provide unprecedented opportunities for health monitoring, applications, and assistive life utilities, particularly for the elderly, disabled, and people with dementia or Alzheimer disease. Due to sensor data nature with different sampling rates and complex correlations, significant challenges arise due to storage, presentation, exchange and manipulate of this data category. One rational solution to solve such challenges is to use techniques which are based on Semantic Web and Ontology. Recently there have been large varieties of proposed approaches in which they use such techniques. The vast amount of human activity recognition in smart home while using Ontological approaches has made it difficult to make adequate comparisons and accurate assessment. This article presents a framework for analyzing each of the approaches proposed in this regard. Using the proposed SOnAr framework for Ontology-based activity recognition approaches can be effective in analyzing and evaluating different methods in different application areas and dealing with various challenges.},

abstract={Loneliness is a common condition in elderly associated with severe health consequences including increased mortality, decreased cognitive function, and poor quality of life. Identifying and assisting lonely individuals is therefore increasingly important-especially in the home setting-as the very nature of loneliness often makes it difficult to detect by traditional methods. One critical component in assessing loneliness unobtrusively is to measure time spent out-of-home, as loneliness often presents with decreased physical activity, decreased motor functioning, and a decline in activities of daily living, all of which may cause decrease in the amount of time spent outside the home. Using passive and unobtrusive in-home sensing technologies, we have developed a methodology for detecting time spent out-of-home based on logistic regression. Our approach was both sensitive (0.939) and specific (0.975) in detecting time out-of-home across over 41 000 epochs of data collected from four subjects monitored for at least 30 days each in their own homes. In addition to linking time spent out-of-home to loneliness, (r = -0.44, p = 0.011) as measured by the UCLA Loneliness Index, we demonstrate its usefulness in other applications such as uncovering general behavioral patterns of elderly and exploring the link between time spent out-of-home and physical activity ( r = 0.415, p = 0.031), as measured by the Berkman Social Disengagement Index.},

To address this challenge, we designed a smart home system with a multi-agent middle layer to study case-based reasoning methods and constraint satisfaction for activity recognition.

abstract={With the rising age of the population, there is increased need to help elderly maintain their independence. Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing, accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of the more important aspects of elders' behaviors that could be assessed with smart home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model, and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors.},

abstract={The increased growth of the aging population (i.e., 65 years or older) has led to emerging technologies in health care that provide in-home support to patients using devices throughout the household. Such smart home environments can monitor and interact with patients and their doctors/caregivers to augment patient medical data for diagnosis than can be generated via traditional doctor visits. Moreover, smart homes are enabling older adults to stay at home longer as opposed to permanent moves to assisted living or nursing facilities, increasing health and well-being and decreasing overall costs to the individual and society at large. This paper proposes Cognitive Assisted Living (CAL), a cyber-physical system comprising a network of embedded devices for collecting and analyzing patient speech patterns over time for monitoring cognitive function beginning in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, CAL will analyze patient speech patterns and spatial abilities, via a set of daily interactions, to provide a longitudinal analysis of speech deterioration, a significant indicator of cognitive decline resulting from Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the rate of cognitive decline can enable caregivers and health care professionals to better manage the patient's daily care and medical requirements. Additionally, the patient's cognitive state can be shared across household devices to increase the patient's comfort and better accommodate lifestyle changes. To these ends, we describe the architecture of the proposed system, the methods to which we will detect cognitive decline, and specify how the system will provide continuing fault tolerance and data security at run time.},

abstract={Intelligent systems and smart devices have played the major role in improving the healthcare organisation in terms of continuous tele-monitoring therapy and maintaining telemedicine management system for sickle cell disease. The biggest challenge facing majority of patients is the fact that there is still a lack of communication with healthcare professionals. Smart home (out-of hospital care) can raise personal self-sufficiency in association with living independently for longer as this disease is considered life-long condition. By using a self-care management system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people. This paper describes the state of the art in pervasive healthcare applications and the communication technologies that assist healthcare providers to offer better services for patients. This research proposes an alert system that could send immediate information to the medical consultants once detects serious condition from the collected data of the patient. Furthermore, the system is able to track various types of symptoms through mobile application in the purpose of obtaining support from medical specialists when it is required.

Sensing, monitoring, recognizing activities of daily living, ultimately delivering immediate healthcare services has been perceived as a prerequisite for detecting the health status of the users. To date, extensive research been made in above-mentioned areas, which is frequently named Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Recently, the term of Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerging, which emphasizes the interconnection of all available resources both physical and virtual with the purpose of collecting and exchanging data. Thus, IoT technologies have been widely adopted for the gathering of health related resources to provide reliable and effective healthcare services especially to elderly and people with chronic diseases. Thereby, the aim of this paper is to present a brief overview of IoT enabled AAL systems and application particularly in the healthcare domain, and then identify the existing challenges and future research opportunities in this field.},

abstract={Obtrusive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most important sleep disorders because it has a direct adverse impact on the quality of life. Intellectual deterioration, decreased psychomotor performance, behavior, and personality disorders are some of the consequences of OSA. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of this disorder is a critical need in healthcare solutions. There are several systems for OSA detection. Nevertheless, despite their promising results, these systems not guiding their treatment. For these reasons, this research presents an innovative system for both to detect and support of treatment of OSA of elderly people by monitoring multiple factors such as sleep environment, sleep status, physical activities, and physiological parameters as well as the use of open data available in smart cities. Our system architecture performs two types of processing. On the one hand, a pre-processing based on rules that enables the sending of real-time notifications to responsible for the care of elderly, in the event of an emergency situation. This pre-processing is essentially based on a fog computing approach implemented in a smart device operating at the edge of the network that additionally offers advanced interoperability services: technical, syntactic, and semantic. On the other hand, a batch data processing that enables a descriptive analysis that statistically details the behavior of the data and a predictive analysis for the development of services, such as predicting the least polluted place to perform outdoor activities. This processing uses big data tools on cloud computing. The performed experiments show a 93.3% of effectivity in the air quality index prediction to guide the OSA treatment. The system's performance has been evaluated in terms of latency. The achieved results clearly demonstrate that the pre-processing of data at the edge of the network improves the efficiency of the system.},

The system could be temporarily rented from a service company by, for example, hospitals, elderly service providers, specialized physiological rehabilitation centers, or individuals. Our system consists of a chosen set of sensors, a wireless sensor network, a home client, and a distant server. We evaluated our concept in two initial trials: one with an elderly woman living in sheltered housing, and the other with a hip surgery patient during his rehabilitation phase. The results prove the functionality of the platform. However, efficient utilization of such platforms requires further work on the actual e-Health service concepts.},

abstract={Data streams from various Internet-Of-Things (IOT) enabled sensors in smart homes provide an opportunity to develop predictive models to offer actionable insights in form of preventive care to its residence. This becomes particularly relevant for Aging-In-Place (AIP) solutions for the care of the elderly. Over the last decade, diverse stakeholders from practice, industry, education, research, and professional organizations have collaborated to furnish homes with a variety of IOT enabled sensors to record daily activities of individuals. Machine Learning on such streams allows for detection of patterns and prediction of activities which enables preventive care. Behavior patterns that lead to preventive care constitute a series of activities. Accurate labeling of activities is an extremely time-consuming process and the resulting labels are often noisy and error prone. In this paper, we analyze the classification accuracy of various activities within a home using machine learning models. We present that the use of an ensemble model that combines multiple learning models allows to obtain better classification of activities than any of the constituent learning algorithms.},

To speed up the development process and to make the applications more adaptive and flexible to special user needs as well as to ensure compatibility throughout systems a common middleware with standardized interfaces is desirable. The integration of off-the-shelf sensor hardware is an important aspect to assure longterm applicability and interoperability. AIT Austrian Institute of Technology has developed a modular software platform providing services to enable independent living for elder people at home. The platform is based on state-of-the-art software development techniques like OSGi and Spring, which enable modularity and flexibility. The aspect of interoperability at the hardware level is considered by integrating standards from the two areas of medical informatics and home automation. A hardware abstraction module harmonizes data from different sensor networks in terms of a common data format. Based on sensor data, functionalities for the detection of specific events and situations in the AAL domain have been implemented using finite state machines and simple statistical methods.},

abstract={Activity recognition in smart homes plays an important role in healthcare by maintaining the well being of elderly and patients through remote monitoring and assisted technologies. In this paper, we propose a two level classification approach for activity recognition by utilizing the information obtained from the sensors deployed in a smart home. In order to separates the similar activities from the non similar activities, we group the homogeneous activities using the Lloyd's clustering algorithm. For the classification of non-separated activities within each cluster, we apply a computationally less expensive learning algorithm Evidence Theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor, which performs better in uncertain conditions and noisy data. The approach enables us to achieve improved recognition accuracy particularly for overlapping activities. A comparison of the proposed approach with the existing activity recognition approaches is presented on two publicly available smart home datasets. The proposed approach demonstrates better recognition rate compared to the existing methods.},

abstract={Systems enabling long-term monitoring of physiological data and everyday activities has been the subject of considerable research efforts in the last years, in order to improve the quality of life of patients, elderly people and common citizens at home, out of the hospitalization. With the availability of inexpensive, low power, wireless and integrated devices, current smart homes are typically equipped with a large amount of sensors, which collaboratively process and make deductions from the acquired data on the state of the home, as well as the activities and behaviors of its residents. According to the field of application and the end-users involved (healthy people, elderly, people with disabilities), the definition of the parameters (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, activity, body mass, etc.) and the appropriate sensors (electrocardiogram, sphygmomanometer, glucometer, etc.) for their acquisition assume a fundamental role. One of the goals of the Italian project Health@Home is to create a network of health sensors and home automation devices to monitor the user's status within the home environment. We present a candidate implementation of such a system, describing the software architecture and the selected components, and a testbed of the architecture, realized in a lab room and used for a preliminary experimental study involving seven users.},

abstract={Advances in multimedia technologies have led to the emergence of smart home applications. In fact, mobile multimedia technologies provide the infrastructure to adopt smart solutions and track inhabitants' activities. In-home activity recognition significantly enhances the performance of healthcaremonitoring and emergency-control applications for elderly and people with special needs. Developing and validating data models for such applications requires training sets that reflect a ground truth in the form of labeled or annotated data. With the accelerated development of Internet-of-Things applications, automated annotation processes have emerged understanding resident behavior in terms of activities. This paper presents a methodology for automatic data annotation by profiling sensing nodes. Our proposed methodology models activities based on spatially recognized actions, with every activity expected to have a direct relationship with a specific set of locations. Furthermore, the proposed technique validates the assignment of labels based on the temporal relations among consecutive actions. We performed experiments to evaluate our proposed methodology on CASAS data sets, which indicated that the proposed methodology achieved better performance, to a statistically significant extent, than the state-of-the-art methodologies presented in the literature.},

abstract={Elderly population (over the age of 60) is predicted to be 1.2 billion by 2025. Most of the elderly people would like to stay alone in their own house due to the high eldercare cost and privacy invasion. Unobtrusive activity recognition is the most preferred solution for monitoring daily activities of the elderly people living alone rather than the camera and wearable devices based systems. Thus, we propose an unobtrusive activity recognition classifier using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and anonymous binary sensors that are passive infrared motion sensors and door sensors. We employed Aruba annotated open data set that was acquired from a smart home where a voluntary single elderly woman was living inside for eight months. First, ten basic daily activities, namely, Eating, Bed_to_Toilet, Relax, Meal_Preparation, Sleeping, Work, Housekeeping, Wash_Dishes, Enter_Home, and Leave_Home are segmented with different sliding window sizes, and then converted into binary activity images. Next, the activity images are employed as the ground truth for the proposed DCNN model. The 10-fold cross-validation evaluation results indicated that our proposed DCNN model outperforms the existing models with F1-score of 0.79 and 0.951 for all ten activities and eight activities (excluding Leave_Home and Wash_Dishes), respectively.},

abstract={The ever-growing life expectancy of people requires the adoption of proper solutions for addressing the particular needs of elderly people in a sustainable way, both from service provision and economic point of view. Mild cognitive impairments and frailty are typical examples of elderly conditions which, if not timely addressed, can turn out into more complex diseases that are harder and costlier to treat. Information and communication technologies, and in particular Internet of Things technologies, can foster the creation of monitoring and intervention systems, both on an ambient-assisted living and smart city scope, for early detecting behavioral changes in elderly people. This allows to timely detect any potential risky situation and properly intervene, with benefits in terms of treatment's costs. In this context, as part of the H2020-funded City4Age project, this paper presents the data capturing and data management layers of the whole City4Age platform. In particular, this paper deals with an unobtrusive data gathering system implementation to collect data about daily activities of elderly people, and with the implementation of the related linked open data (LOD)-based data management system. The collected data are then used by other layers of the platform to perform risk detection algorithms and generate the proper customized interventions. Through the validation of some use-cases, it is demonstrated how this scalable approach, also characterized by unobtrusive and low-cost sensing technologies, can produce data with a high level of abstraction useful to define a risk profile of each elderly person.},

abstract={With advancements in wireless technologies, location based services (LBS) have become ubiquitous and are fundamental to services that provide emergency response to those that enhance the quality of daily life. Location tracking applications include traffic congestion management, waste management, indoor navigation in malls/airports, receiving coupons/advertisements by retailers, applications to allow parents to track their children, providing centimeter-level guidance to visually impaired users in indoor environments etc. Location tracking also enables applications in device-free situations - intrusion detection by means of tracking people and their movements through walls, monitoring the heartbeat of a person(ex: elderly citizen) through walls etc. In conjunction with location based services, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) provides rich contextual information which is key to the scalability of smart cities. Managing these technologies along with establishing effective countermeasures against security and privacy concerns of individual citizens as well as service providers and government agencies is essential for their adoption. In this paper we envision a feature of the emergency response system of a smart city whereby critical contextual information from the emergency site is made available to the emergency service provider to enable effective first response strategy. We use the example of a smart building with an infrastructure that consists of an indoor hybrid wireless environment for identifying individuals, tracking their location, monitoring vital statistics and measuring ambient conditions. This information is critical to rescue teams and paramedics. We provide an architecture that addresses the security and privacy issues associated with the highly sensitive information generated by this system.},

abstract={One of the greatest challenges in Ambient Assisted Living is to design health smart homes that could be able to anticipate the needs of its inhabitant while maintaining their comfort and their safety with an adaptation of the house environment and a facilitation of the connections to the outside world. The most likely to benefit from these smart homes are people in loss of autonomy such as the disabled people or the elderly with cognitive deficiencies. But it becomes essential to ease the interactions with the smart home through dedicated interfaces, in particular, thanks to systems reactive to vocal orders. Audio recognition is also a promising way to ensure more safety by contributing to detection of distress situations. This paper presents the stakes and the challenges of this domain based on some experiments carried out concerning distress call recognition and sound classification at home.},

abstract={Smart monitoring of seniors behavioural patterns and more specifically activities of daily living have attracted immense research interest in recent years. Development of smart decision support systems to support the promotion of health smart homes has also emerged taking advantage of the plethora of smart, inexpensive and unobtrusive monitoring sensors, devices and software tools. To this end, a smart monitoring system has been used in order to extract meaningful information about television (TV) usage patterns and subsequently associate them with clinical findings of experts. The smart TV operating state remote monitoring system was installed in four elderly women homes and gathered data for more than 11 months. Results suggest that TV daily usage (time the TV is turned on) can predict mental health change. Conclusively, the authors suggest that collection of smart device usage patterns could strengthen the inference capabilities of existing health DSSs applied in uncontrolled settings such as real senior homes.},

abstract={Objective: To design, implement, and test a solution to provide social and health services for the elderly at home based on smart TV technologies and access to all services. Methods: The architecture proposed is based on an open software platform and standard personal computing hardware. This provides great flexibility to develop new applications over the underlying infrastructure or to integrate new devices, for instance to monitor a broad range of vital signs in those cases where home monitoring is required. Results: An actual system as a proof-of-concept was designed, implemented, and deployed. Applications range from social network clients to vital signs monitoring; from interactive TV contests to conventional online care applications such as medication reminders or telemedicine. Conclusion: In both cases, the results have been very positive, confirming the initial perception of the TV as a convenient, easy-to-use technology to provide social and health care. The TV set is a much more familiar computing interface for most senior users, and as a consequence, smart TVs become a most convenient solution for the design and implementation of applications and services targeted to this user group. Significance: This proposal has been tested in real setting with 62 senior people at their homes. Users included both individuals with experience using computers and others reluctant to them.},

abstract={Modern buildings are equipped with multiple systems, which are dedicated to improve quality of living for inhabitants and to facilitate performance of daily duties for maintenance personnel. Yet the variety of the systems causes the bulky informational flow, which may result informational tense to the user, time lost and increase of errors. To make life comfortable in a smart house, the inhabitants of the building should have an access to the simple and intuitive control and monitoring of the apartment, and the maintenance personnel should have a handily informational support for the prioritizing and efficient performance of the maintenance tasks. Thus, there is a need in intelligent management of information flow to provide data to the users with regards to the context like for instance on-going situation and goals, user's intentions, state and role in the system. This paper proposes framework of context-aware middleware as a solution for information management in the system. Context-awareness is achieved with ontological knowledge models of the system and two-level reasoning upon the ontologies. The enabled technologies are discussed with relation to the use case, which is a combination of smart home and elderly care services. Future steps towards framework realization end the paper.},

pages={288-295}, 
abstract={With recent advancements in ubiquitous sensor technologies and smart environments, routine discovery has emerged as a highly studied problem because of its applications in smart home automation, anomaly detection and assisted living for elderly. Routines can be categorized on the basis of some discernible properties like frequency, recurrence and periodicity. Commonly researched solutions to discover routines/activities of daily living are based on topic modeling or association rule mining (ARM). Both ARM and topic modeling based approaches are computationally expensive and do not acknowledge routine categorization, hence are not guaranteed to discover all different kinds of routines. In this paper we propose a simple, efficient and unsupervised framework for routine discovery in smart homes based by exploiting properties of routines which categorize them. We define and leverage such properties to discover routines utilizing an iterative algorithm, where routines from a specific category are discovered at each iteration. We have demonstrated a routine discovery system FIBI by implementing the framework and have achieved more than 80% recall and more than 90% precision across different categories of routines defined under FIBI, across three different market segments - social climber, affluent nester and urban dweller.},

volume={24},

pages={961-974}, 
abstract={This paper introduces a knowledge-driven approach to real-time, continuous activity recognition based on multisensor data streams in smart homes. The approach goes beyond the traditional data-centric methods for activity recognition in three ways. First, it makes extensive use of domain knowledge in the life cycle of activity recognition. Second, it uses ontologies for explicit context and activity modeling and representation. Third and finally, it exploits semantic reasoning and classification for activity inferencing, thus enabling both coarse-grained and fine-grained activity recognition. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of smart homes and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) upon which we built both context and ADL ontologies. We present a generic system architecture for the proposed knowledge-driven approach and describe the underlying ontology-based recognition process. Special emphasis is placed on semantic subsumption reasoning algorithms for activity recognition. The proposed approach has been implemented in a function-rich software system, which was deployed in a smart home research laboratory. We evaluated the proposed approach and the developed system through extensive experiments involving a number of various ADL use scenarios. An average activity recognition rate of 94.44 percent was achieved and the average recognition runtime per recognition operation was measured as 2.5 seconds.},

While disruptions in cognition is a striking feature of dementia, it is also closely coupled with changes in functional and behavioral health of older adults. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of improving the automatic assessment of dementia, by better exploiting the emerging physiological sensors in conjunction with ambient sensors in a real field environment with IRB approval. We hypothesize that the cognitive health of older individuals can be estimated by tracking their daily activities and mental arousal states. We employ signal processing on wearable sensor data streams (e.g., Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Photoplethysmogram (PPG), accelerometer (ACC)) and machine learning algorithms to assess cognitive impairments and its correlation with functional health decline. To validate our approach, we quantify the score of machine learning, survey and observation based Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and signal processing based mental arousal state, respectively for functional and behavioral health measures among 17 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community in Baltimore. We compare clinically observed scores with technology guided automated scores using both machine learning and statistical techniques.},

abstract={Smart health home systems and assisted living architectures rely on severely energy-constrained sensing devices, such as wearable sensors, for the generation of data and their reliable wireless communication to a central location. However, the need for recharging the battery regularly constitutes a maintenance burden that hinders the long-term cost-effectiveness of these systems, especially for health-oriented applications that target people in need, such as the elderly or the chronically ill. These sensing systems generate raw data that is processed into knowledge by reasoning and machine learning algorithms. This paper investigates the benefits of embedded machine learning, i.e. executing this knowledge extraction on the wearable sensor, instead of communicating abundant raw data over the low power network. Focusing on a simple classification task and using an accelerometer-based wearable sensor, we demonstrate that embedded machine learning has the potential to reduce the radio and processor duty cycle by several orders of magnitude; and, thus, substantially extend the battery lifetime of resource-constrained wearable sensors.},

abstract={Smart home is an alternative function in present accommodation. Many technologies are developed for smart home. Human gait recognition system for indoor area is applied for monitoring purpose such as elder health care system. However, simple and effective algorithm is necessary for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new method of human gait identification system for indoor area by using human joints projection and closest distance technique. The algorithm consists of four step: image sequence acquisition, human joints segmentation, human joints projection and gait recognition. Firstly, human 2D sequence image is acquired. Red nine markers are attached on human joints. Secondly, markers are extracted by color thresholding technique. Human joints are then tracked. Third, such joints is projected in a dimension. Finally, Euclidean distance technique is used to compare two 2D human points between test data and train data. Human gait is recognized by the closest distance. To evaluate the proposed method, fifteen subjects walk pass 2D camera in same one way. A subject was tested three time. Average accuracy rate is 95.55%. This method perform effectively. The advantages of this method over existing methods is simple algorithm and effective for small size of target as using in accommodation.},

abstract={A real-time life logging system that provide monitoring, recording and recognition of daily human activities using video cameras offers life-care or health-care services at smart homes. Such a vision-based life logging system can provide continuous monitoring and recording of a resident's daily activities from which one can obtain behavior patterns of daily life events and improve the quality of life especially for the elderly. This paper presents a real-time life logging system via depth imaging-based human activity recognition. A depth imaging device is utilized to obtain depth silhouettes of human activities. Then from the silhouettes, human body points information gets extracted and used in activity recognition, producing life logs. The system is composed of two key processes; one is training of the life logging system, and the other is running the trained life-logging system to record life logs. In the training process, the system includes the data collection from a depth camera, extraction of body points features from each depth silhouette and finally training of the activity recognizer (i.e., Hidden Markov Models). Then, after training, one can run the trained system which recognizes learned activities and store life logs in real-time. The proposed approach is evaluated against the life logging system that uses the conventional principal components (PC) and Radon transform features of depth silhouettes and achieves superior recognition rate. Real-time experimental results show the feasibility and functionality of the implemented system which could be used to generate life logs of human activities at smart homes.},

abstract={Elderly in-home assistance (EHA) has traditionally been tackled by human caregivers to equip the elderly with homecare assistance in their daily living. The emerging ambience intelligence (AmI) technology suggests itself to be of great potential for EHA applications, owing to its effectiveness in building a context-aware environment that is sensitive and responsive to the presence of humans. This paper presents a case-driven AmI (C-AmI) system, aiming to sense, predict, reason, and act in response to the elderly activities of daily living (ADLs) at home. The C-AmI system architecture is developed by synthesizing various sensors, activity recognition, case-based reasoning, along with EHA-customized knowledge, within a coherent framework. An EHA information model is formulated through the activity recognition, case comprehension, and assistive action layers. The rough set theory is applied to model ADLs based on the sensor platform embedded in a smart home. Assistive actions are fulfilled with reference to a priori case solutions and implemented within the AmI system through human-object-environment interactions. Initial findings indicate the potential of C-AmI for enhancing context awareness of EHA applications.},

abstract={The high development of medicine causes the world's population aging quickly. To resolve the problem with limited medical resources, constant monitoring of elders' activity of daily living is important. We propose an activity recognition system for smart home, so elders can live alone and their children can monitor their parents' living activity to achieve the concept of "Aging in Place". The living activity monitoring model is powerful to recognize meaningful activities by using both ambient and wearable sensors. It's feasible to deploy in the real living environment be-cause it's a non-parametric learning model. Elders need less effort to label activity in training part, and the model may have chance to find some special activities that the elders did not consider in the past. We demonstrate the living activity monitoring model is feasible to be deployed in a living home with high accuracy performance of the activity recognition result.},

abstract={Improvements in medicine increase life expectancy in the world and create a new bottleneck at the entrance of specialized and equipped institutions. To allow elderly people to stay at home, researchers work on ways to monitor them in their own environment, with non-invasive sensors. To meet this goal, smart homes, equipped with lots of sensors, deliver information on the activities of the person and can help detect distress situations. In this paper, we present a global speech and sound recognition system that can be set-up in a flat. We placed eight microphones in the Health Smart Home of Grenoble (a real living flat of 47m2) and we automatically analyze and sort out the different sounds recorded in the flat and the speech uttered (to detect normal or distress french sentences). We introduce the methods for the sound and speech recognition, the post-processing of the data and finally the experimental results obtained in real conditions in the flat.},

abstract={South Africa's ageing population is increasing. The elderly prefer to live independently for as long as possible in their own homes. Mobile Monitoring and Care systems (MMCs) are enabling the elderly to live independently while supporting their well-being in the comfort of their homes. However, literature has however shown that the elderly are not willing to make use of MMCs in their homes due to privacy concerns. The purpose of this paper is then to investigate the privacy concerns of the elderly towards the use of MMCs in their home environment. The study makes use of a qualitative, inductive approach. The study found that there are a variety of factors that influences the elderly's privacy concerns to make use of MMCs The study therefore recommends the following: to introduce appropriate privacy legislation, to implement and communicate fair information practices in the MMC industry, raising awareness about the benefits of MMCs among the elderly, developing inconspicuous and unobtrusive MMC technologies and educating the elderly about the privacy controls of MMC devices.},

abstract={Worldwide elderly population is increasing. Many of these elderly are placed in assisted living environment, and they often need cognitive or physical support in their daily lives. To address such need, a lot of attention have been given from various perspectives such as health monitoring, medication adherence, body-sensor network, smart home for elderly and disabled and so on. However, very less focus has been directed to address the entertainment needs of the elderly, which is an important aspect for an enjoyable living. This paper proposes the design of a context-aware elderly entertainment support system (CAEESS) by investigating the entertainment requirements based on the perspectives of elderly and caregiver. Our focus is on the technical platform to fulfill the identified requirements. The proposed system facilitates the elderly to access various entertainment services through different modes of interaction and also empowers the caregiver to select entertainment media or resources for the elderly when needed. We believe that the proposed approach will provide a clear understanding of the requirements of CAEESS and enable us to effectively address the problems related to the independent and happy living of the elderly.},

abstract={Modern societies are facing an important aging of their population, leading to rising economic and social challenges such as the pressure on health support services for semi-autonomous persons. Smart home technology is considered by many researchers as a promising potential solution to help support the needs of elders. It aims to provide cognitive assistance by taking decisions, such as giving hints, suggestions and reminders, with different kinds of effectors (light, sound, screen, etc.) to a resident suffering from cognitive deficits in order to foster their autonomy. To implement such a technology, the first challenge we need to overcome is the recognition of the ongoing inhabitant activity of daily living (ADL). Moreover, to assist them correctly, we also need to be able to detect the perceptive errors they perform. Therefore, we present in this paper a new affordable activity recognition system, based on passive RFID technology and load signatures of appliances, able to detect errors related to cognitive impairment. The whole computational intelligent system is based on a multi-layer model that promotes scalability and adaptability. This system has been implemented and deployed in a real smart home prototype. We also present the promising results of our experiment conducted on real case scenarios about morning routines.},

As an application of this framework, an activity performance-based supervised recommender system to recommend tasks related to different activities in a smart home is presented. Its usefulness to enhance the quality of life of people in technology-laden surroundings can be seen, especially for the elderly people, by providing environments with smart agents, that can effectively assist them in user interactions, as well as recommend tasks or activities, or even guide them through the intended tasks. Furthermore, the future intelligent assistant agents will have to learn a universal set of user interactions related to any activity to effectively mitigate distractions and adapt to the situations and recommend tasks to aid users in reaching to the end goal of performing the desired activity. A preliminary result demonstrates a performance accuracy of 75% when evaluated on a subset of the UK DALE dataset [1].},

abstract={The success of providing smart healthcare services in ambient assisted living (AAL) largely depends on an effective prediction of situations in the environment. Situation awareness in AAL is to determine the environment smartness by perceiving information related to the surroundings and human behavioral changes. In AAL environment, there are plenty of ways to collect data about its inhabitants, such as through cameras, microphones, and other sensors. The collected data are complicated enough to go for an efficient processing in perceiving the situation. This paper gives an overview of the existing research results in multimodal data analysis in AAL environment to improve the living environment of the seniors, and it attempts to bring efficiency in complex event processing for real-time situational awareness. This paper thus considers multimodal sensing for detection of current situations as well as to predict future situations using decision-tree and association analysis algorithms. To illustrate the proposed approach, we consider elderly activity recognition in the AAL environment.},

pages={611-617}, 
abstract={Free of most social constraints, elderly people tend to perform activities of daily living following the same sequence. This paper proposes a method for medical telesurveillance to detect and quantify a nycthemeral shift in this daily routine. While this common phenomenon is mostly mild, in acute cases, however, it may reveal a pathological behavior requiring a rapid medical examination. This method allows to compare two sequences of activities using the Hamming distance and to interpret the result according to the Gumbel distribution. It may be used to compare either consecutive sequences thereby taking into account evolution in the habits or a sequence to the person's individual activity profile to detect dementia's onset. In this early stage, only elementary activities were considered. That is the reason why location data were used to monitor the person's nycthemeral rhythm of activity. IR sensors placed in her own flat allowed us to follow-up the inhabitant's successive activities. Improvements of this method have already been planned. They include the use of a multi-sensors network to monitor both actimetric (location, movement, posture) and physiological nycthemeral rhythms (ECG, respiratory frequency) and to detect the use of particular items (fridge, chairs, bed). This more sophisticated sensors network will allow us to monitor more complex tasks execution and then to detect pathological behaviors such as perseveration in a task or wandering. On the other hand, multiplying sensors will require more storage capacities and the use of time-consuming data fusion tools. Therefore, a classification phase will be necessary to reduce as possible the number of relevant sensors.},

abstract={Activity recognition of an elderly person can be used to provide information and intelligent services to health care professionals, carers, elderly people, and their families so that the elderly people can remain at homes independently. This study investigates the use and contribution of wrist-worn multisensors for activity recognition. We found that accelerometers are the most important sensors and heart rate data can be used to boost classification of activities with diverse heart rates. We propose a genetic algorithm-based fusion weight selection (GAFW) approach which utilizes GA to find fusion weights. For all possible classifier combinations and fusion methods, the study shows that 98% of times GAFW can achieve equal or higher accuracy than the best classifier within the group.},

Thus, monitoring important daily activities through the observation of everyday object usages is one the ways to let know medical personnel about the activities of the patients, and if there is a problem - a nurse or doctor can adequately respond in a timely fashion.

abstract={An exciting paradise of data is emerging into our daily life along with the development of relative perceptive technologies in smart home. How to automatically and actively recognize real-time activities from the big data is one key challenge for the future pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. Solving this problem can greatly enhance the development of relative technologies for eldercare, childcare or healthcare. This paper proposes an event-driven approach, namely activity event model, for real-time activity recognition in smart home (ERAR). The ERAR approach segments data flow based on AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm and recognizes activities based on SVM model. The AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm uses activity event similarity (AES) to dynamically segment data flow, and can effectively distinguish concurrent activities. Experiments in the context of smart home are presented to show that our ERAR approach performs better than the baseline approaches.},

abstract={In the last years, many AAL applications have been developed to support elderly people in conducting a healthier and safer life in their everyday living environment. This paper describes the design of a domestic environment in which an elderly user can perform a tailored physical exercise through a virtual reality-based system, called Smart Home Simulator. The customization of the services offered to specific target users is achieved through the exploitation of ontologies, which model the users' health condition, the domestic environments, diverse comfort metrics and devices. Through the exploitation of a real use-case foreseeing a 72-year-old frail woman who has to train on a cycle-ergometer, a first prototype of the system - called Bicycle4CaRe - has been realized. It is composed of different commercial devices interacting with each other with the aim of providing the end user with a customized intervention and collecting data about environmental conditions and physiological parameters. These data are monitored in real-time to ensure safe conditions of training and, at the end of the exercise, they are saved in report files and they are made available to caregivers and clinicians.},

abstract={Monitoring activities of daily living is one of the key functionalities expected from a Smart Living environment providing independent living services for elderly people. Simple state-change sensors have been considered to be a promising sensing technique to observe the environment and consequently provide the data required to form the basis to infer high-level behaviours. From a data analysis point of view, the challenge is how to recognise and detect activity behaviours from low level sensor data over time. In this paper we present a novel approach to partition sensor data and identify the activity undertaken within each sensor data segment. The approach developed was tested on a dataset collected from a single person living in an apartment during a period of 28 days. The results show that our approach can not only accurately recognise annotated activities but also has the ability to identify non-recorded activities.},

Wandering and disorientation are common symptoms amongst patients with MCI, and they could lead to fatal outcomes.

Cooperation between wireless sensor networks and existing consumer electronic infrastructures can assist in the areas of health care and patient monitoring. This will improve the quality of life of patients, provide early detection for certain ailments, and improve doctor-patient efficiency.

abstract={The highly developed medical technology has increased the average human life span, but also speeds up the process of the world's population aging. In the next few decades, Dementia will affect a considerably increasing number of the elderly. Taking care of the person with dementia is an overwhelming task and can cause physical, emotional and economic pressures to families and caregivers. This works aims to alleviate the caregiver's burden, which can constantly monitor the elderly in smart homes, and in turn, send alert to the caregiver whenever abnormal activities of the elderly occur. This system adopts the unsupervised clustering algorithm, e.g. Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM), to get the potential clusters about the hands movements because the number of clusters is unknown in priori. In order to store spatial information of hands movements within a special activity, N-gram model is used to extract the feature basing on the result of DPMM, and in turn integrate position and hands movement features. The activity recognition (AR) model is used to recognize the living activities with promising performance, in which the precision and recall of this proposed system is up to 96.8% and 96.7%, respectively, even for the similar activities, such as “eating mear' and “having medicine.},

abstract={An increasing elderly population presents challenges and issues on elderly care and support. Assistive Technologies is one of the alternatives to address the growing care needs among the elderly. Beyond technological aspects, the needs, benefits, and barriers play a vital role in the successful use of assistive technologies, which account on this situation, is relatively unexplored in the Philippines. This study attempts to provide an initial understanding of the perceived needs, benefits and barriers to assistive technologies, through a survey among the elderly in the Philippines. Results from the survey indicate that elderly respondents positively perceived the needs of assistive technologies for emergencies, daily activity and health monitoring, navigation, and communication with family and peers. Moreover, the elderly respondents notably perceived benefits from assistive technologies usage includes support for daily activities, assistance in an emergency, increase safety, social interaction, and improve health condition. However, the results also indicate that cost, fear of dependence, need for assistance, privacy and security, and control and autonomy as barriers in the assistive technologies usage. The results of this study will be used as input in a current project of designing an intelligent assistive technology for elderly in the Philippines. Therefore, this study extends understanding on elderly perspectives on assistive technologies in a developing country perspective. Implications for theory and practice are presented.},

Background subtraction is applied to extract the foreground human body and the result is improved by using certain postprocessing. Information from ellipse fitting and a projection histogram along the axes of the ellipse is used as the features for distinguishing different postures of the human. These features are then fed into a directed acyclic graph support vector machine for posture classification, the result of which is then combined with derived floor information to detect a fall. From a dataset of 15 people, we show that our fall detection system can achieve a high fall detection rate (97.08%) and a very low false detection rate (0.8%) in a simulated home environment.},

We assume smart home as an intelligent agent to perceive the environment and process the sensory data on cloud. Smartphone application communicates with cloud through web services and assists the elderly person to complete their daily life activities. It facilitates the care giver assistant by tracking the elderly persons in their own homes and avoids certain accidents. Furthermore, it also helps the family members to track the activities, when they are outside from homes.},

abstract={Due to the demographic change in western society, new challenges regarding healthcare of the elderly population are at the verge of surfacing. Since young people are not capable of sustaining an adequate healthcare for elderly people, new healthcare fields have to be devised. Recent advances in information and communication technology enable the support of elderly people in their domestic environment. The EU project RADIO will design of an old age compliant smart home environment which specializes in fulfilling the needs of elderly people. This is partially achieved through a mobile robot platform which serves as an assistant to the respective elderly person. Apart from this, the robot also functions as a mobile sensor platform. Under this context, unobtrusiveness is of paramount importance since the robot should be a natural participant of patients' daily life. This paper discusses such a healthcare facility, analyses its requirements and poses the challenges towards this direction.},

abstract={There is an increasing interest in real-time fall detection systems for the elderly in developed countries because more and more elderly are staying alone. There is a great demand for such fall detections systems in the smart home industry and the healthcare industry. Various fall detection approaches have been proposed recently by researchers. However, the majority of the proposed approaches require sensors to be attached on the subjects under surveillance. Sensors are intrusive and restrictive. Moreover, critical situations can often go undetected if the elderly forget to wear those vital sensors. As a result, researchers have recently gained interest in computer vision based solutions. Viewpoint invariance is a very important issue in computer vision because camera position is arbitrary and the subjects are free to move around in the environment. This paper presents a vision-based framework that can detect falls using a single camera, irrespective of the viewpoint of the camera with respect to the subjects. The proposed system makes use of invariant pose models which perform view-invariant human pose recognition. An ensemble of pose models performs inference on each video frame. Each pose model employs an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the probability that the given frame contains the corresponding pose. Over a sequence of frames, all the pose models collectively produce a multivariate time series. The system detects falls by analyzing the time series. We utilize the fuzzy hidden Markov model (FHMM) to detect falls. We have performed some experiments on two datasets and the results are found to be promising.},

In the framework of Health Smart Home, the purpose is to maintain and supervise elderly or fragile people at home. Activity and autonomy levels are important criteria to evaluate the health of the patient. The time spent in each postural state (lying, sitting, standing), the periods of walking and the number of postural transitions: sit-to-stand (StS), back-to-sit (BtS) give information about the patient's activity. The purpose of the current study is to detect these activities using an unique sensor made of three accelerometers, attached to the chest. First, this paper describes how each algorithm (posture, walk, postural transitions) works. Secondly, the results on real data are shown. An experiment with elderly subjects was carried out.

abstract={The latest advances in electronic and telecommunication have led to the introduction of intelligent and complex systems: the Wireless Sensor Networks. This technology has become even more important with the advent of the Internet of Things: each node acquires an IPv6 address and can be directly accessed from remote when the switch from IPv4 to IPv6 will take place. Such systems are actually applied in environment monitoring, home automation, industry, and lot of other fields. The Ambient Assisted Living scenery is a perfect field of application for sensor networks based on the IP protocol. The monitoring of elderly people, the automation of home appliances and the assistance to the person can be easily achieved through a network based on IPv6. Furthermore, such a system allows to obtain a maximum interoperability with existent networks, avoiding the need for inconvenient gateways to interface systems with different communication protocols. The presented work describes a complete hardware and software system able to solve the interoperability issue among Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living. Sub GHz frequency, mesh topology and low power consumption give a competitive advantage to the system against Bluetooth Low Energy or ZigBee technology.},

abstract={In this paper, we examine at-home activity rhythms and present a dozen of behavioral patterns obtained from an activity monitoring pilot study of 22 residents in an assisted living setting with four case studies. Established behavioral patterns have been captured using custom software based on a statistical predictive algorithm that models circadian activity rhythms (CARs) and their deviations. The CAR was statistically estimated based on the average amount of time a resident spent in each room within their assisted living apartment, and also on the activity level given by the average n.umber of motion events per room. A validated in-home monitoring system (IMS) recorded the monitored resident's movement data and established the occupancy period and activity level for each room. Using these data, residents' circadian behaviors were extracted, deviations indicating anomalies were detected, and the latter were correlated to activity reports generated by the IMS as well as notes of the facility's professional caregivers on the monitored residents. The system could be used to detect deviations in activity patterns and to warn caregivers of such deviations, which could reflect changes in health status, thus providing caregivers with the opportunity to apply standard of care diagnostics and to intervene in a timely manner.},

abstract={We present an approach that combines semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool to enable the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users. In contrast to process-driven systems where service mashups are statically defined, this approach makes use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of the presented system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support end users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system. This tool enables users to model the desired state of their smart environment graphically and thus hides the technicalities of the underlying semantics and the reasoning. Possible applications of the presented system include the configuration of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.},

In addition to investigating energy and environment infrastructure and services, the project Brescia Smart Living wants to experience new remote monitoring services. The elderly is constantly monitored by a system of wearable and home sensors; a smartphone, acting as a home gateway, stores and elaborates data and reports events to one or more people chosen by the elderly person.

abstract={With a growing population of elderly people, the number of subjects at risk of cognitive disorders is rapidly increasing. Many research groups are studying pervasive solutions to continuously and unobtrusively monitor fragile subjects in their homes. Clinicians are interested in monitoring several behavioral aspects for a wide variety of applications: early diagnosis, emergency monitoring, assessment of cognitive disorders, etcetera. Among the several behavioral aspects of interest, anomalous behaviors while performing activities of daily living (ADLs) are of great importance. Indeed, these anomalies can be indicators of cognitive decline. The recognition of such abnormal behaviors relies on robust and accurate ADLs recognition systems. Moreover, in order to enable unobtrusive and privacy-aware monitoring, environmental sensors in charge of unobtrusively capturing the interaction of the subject with the home infrastructure should be preferred. This talk presents our latest research efforts on these topics. In particular, the talk will cover: a) novel unobtrusive sensing solutions, b) hybrid ADLs recognition methods and c) techniques to detect abnormal behaviors at a fine granularity. We will discuss those challenges reporting our experience and identifying critical aspects which still need to be investigated.},

year={2015},

pages={427-436}, 
abstract={With the advent of ubiquitous computing and sensor technologies, indoor trajectory data of individuals can readily be collected to support analysis of their underlying movement behaviors. Different methods for activity recognition have been proposed where supervised learning algorithms are often adopted. In many applications like elderly care, the behaviors to be characterized are often not known in a priori and the behaviors of different individuals cannot be assumed similar even for the same activity type. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning methodology to first extract from the trajectory data of an individual behavioral patterns as representations of his/her daily activities, and then infer the patterns' occurrence per day for daily routine analysis. Extracting behavioral patterns is challenging as the patterns often carry long-range dependency and appear with spatio-temporal variations, making the conventional frequent pattern mining approach not suitable. We propose to model the trajectory data using a behavior-aware flow graph which is a probabilistic finite state automaton where the nodes and edges are attributed with local behavioral features. We then apply the weighted kernel k-means algorithm to the flow graph to identify sub flows as the behavioral patterns, followed by non-negative matrix factorization to compute the daily routine patterns. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we applied it to a publicly available data set that contains trajectories of an elder living in a smart home for 219 days. With reference to the ground truth, our experimental results show that the proposed flow graph allows more accurate activity-specific behavioral patterns to be extracted as compared to a frequent pattern clustering approach. Also, we illustrate how the proposed method can be used to support daily routine analysis.},

In this paper, we propose a simple unobtrusive sensing system using passive infra-red motion sensors to monitor the activities of daily living of elderly, who are living alone. A feature extraction module comprising of three layers-states, events, and activities, and the corresponding algorithms are proposed to extract features. Four popular classification models-neural network, C4.5 decision tree, Bayesian network, and support vector machine are then applied to detect the severity of depression. We implement and test the algorithms on sensor data collected over three months from 20 elderly, each in different daily living conditions. Our evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms are effective in detecting both normal condition and mild depression with up to 96% accuracy, using neural network as the classification algorithm. The sensing system is non-intrusive and cost-effective, with the potential of use for long-term depression monitoring and detection of early symptoms of mental related disorders. This enables caregivers to provide timely interventions to elderly, who are at risk of depression.},

Drawn from the framework of basic human values and the unique experience of the SHINESeniors project, the study extracts the core values for elderly and caregivers using a multi-method case analysis.

abstract={Smart environments have progressed and evolved into a significant research area with development of sensor technology, wireless communication and machine learning strategies. Ambient Intelligence incorporated into smart environment assists in resolving many social related applications to facilitate the future society. The initiative of modeling Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in smart homes have helped in the deployment of applications to various domains like elderly care, health care etc. Activity recognition is the task involved in reasoning within smart homes with the aim of recognizing the ongoing activity of the occupant. Constructing an activity model is essential to carry out recognition and is achieved through various machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Data driven approach constructs activity model through statistical machine learning mechanisms while knowledge driven approach constructs activity model through knowledge representation and modeling strategies. Uncertainty and temporal data are better handled by data driven approach while re-usability and context based analysis is handled better by knowledge driven approach of activity modeling. To combine the features of data driven and knowledge driven approaches, a hybrid activity modeling technique is required. The proposed system performs activity modeling via Markov Logic Network, a machine learning strategy that combines probabilistic reasoning and logical reasoning with a single framework. Activities in a smart home are categorized as simple and composite activities, wherein composite activities are defined as related simple activities within a given time interval. The proposed system models both simple and composite activity using soft and hard rules of MLN. Experiments carried over the proposed system shows the effectiveness of the proposed work for recognizing simple and composite activity.},

abstract={This study is included in the framework of Health Smart Homes which monitor some physiological or not physiological parameters of elderly people living independently at home. In this study we will focus on the walk detection. Walk activity is one parameter to evaluate the health of patient. For example, the total time of walk during a day allows assessing quickly if the subject is mobile rather than immobile. To reach this goal we used a kinematic sensor placed on the chest recording the movements of the subject. The data are analyzed by six algorithms to detect walk phases: two based on Fourier analysis and the others using a wavelet decomposition (DWT and CWT). All algorithms are described and the performances are evaluated on real data recorded with 20 elderly people. Results show that the method using the DWT decomposition is the most efficient (78.5% in sensitivity and 67.6% in specificity)},

abstract={Monitoring elderly or disabled people in smart home environments is a major area of research because it allows for controlling chronic diseases and promises cost reduction. Context recognition and in particular activity recognition is of key importance as it facilitates the interpretation of data from medical monitoring devices. In our study with five elderly or disabled people we used data from multi-sensor wearable devices to generate intra- and interindividual machine-learned classifier models to determine activity patterns. Furthermore we computed the relative relevance of each parameter measured, and assessed the acceptance of computerized questionnaires in computer- illiterate people. The mean classification accuracy was 91.4% for the intraindividual classifiers and 53.7% for the interindividual ones. The most relevant parameters for activity classifications were those derived from accelerometric data, the least relevant one was galvanic skin response. Both the sensor device and the computerized questionnaires were well-received by the study participants. Individually-trained machine-learned classifiers used on data from a wearable device are an adequate means to determine context in elderly or disabled people.},

abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare applications envision future computing and networking environments as being filled with sensors that can determine various types of contexts of its inhabitants, such as location, activity and vital signs. While such information is useful in providing context-sensitive services to the inhabitants to promote intelligent independent living, however in reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts may often be ambiguous. Thus, a challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services is the ability to handle ambiguous contexts to prevent hazardous situations. In this paper, we propose a framework which supports efficient context-aware data fusion for healthcare applications that assume contexts could be ambiguous. Our framework provides a systematic approach to derive context fragments, and deal with context ambiguity in a probabilistic manner. We also incorporate the ability to represent contexts within the applications, and the ability to easily compose rules to mediate ambiguous contexts. Through simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for monitoring elderly people in the smart home environment.},

abstract={This paper presents a temperature management system (TMS) to prevent heat shock in a house using Internet of Things technology. Heat shock is a serious problem for elderly people in Japan, particularly those with heart disease or a cerebral infarction. To prevent heat shock in the home, stable temperature control is necessary. Therefore, the proposed TMS implements two main functions: one is controlling the heat, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system according to the collected environmental data using networked sensors, and the other is providing information through a webpage instructing how to prevent the effects of heat shock. To test the applicability of this system, a feasibility study was conducted using two households for two weeks during the winter. To evaluate the system, the data and impressions of the users were collected. The results show that the system is able to maintain stable temperatures between different rooms in a home and provide useful information.},

The results show that the MCRF anomaly recognition based on feature merging can recognize the anomalies in real time and accurately.

abstract={Falling is a major cause of death among elders. To detect falls, numerous approaches have been proposed in the past decade, including computer-vision based image processing, wearable sensors, and acoustic signal processing, etc. Though the recent advancement in infra-red LED, depth camera, MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors and machine learning algorithms may have enlarged the application scope, the privacy intrusion and lack of convenience still remain to be open issues which prevent these systems from large deployment. A novel Sensing-Fi system described in this paper aims to overcome such deficiencies. The system design is comprised of harnessing Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) coupled with ground-mounted accelerometer to detect floor vibration, hence the system is completely passive and non-invasive, i.e., the user is not required to wear the technology contrary to wearable accelerometers. In addition, contrary to the existing standalone Wi-Fi CSI fall detection systems, it overcomes the constraint by which only one user can be present in the room. The system has shown promising results with 95% accuracy.},

In this paper, an innovative HAR system, exploiting the potential of wearable devices integrated with the skills of deep learning techniques, is presented with the aim of recognizing the most common daily activities of a person at home. The designed wearable sensor embeds an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Wi-Fi section to send data on a cloud service and to allow direct connection to the Internet through a common home router so that the user themselves could manage the installation procedure. The sensor is coupled to a CNN network designed to make inferences with the minimum possible resources to keep open the way of its implementation on low-cost or embedded devices. The system is conceived for daily activity monitor and nine different activities can be highlighted with an accuracy of 97%.},

abstract={An important function for a smart health care system, aiming to maximize safety and comfort to elderly or people with dysfunctional legs, is the automatic detection of a wheelchair captured from a visual surveillance system. In this paper, we proposed a method for detecting a two-dimensional wheelchair image using a combination of the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The proposed method consists of three main steps: (i). foreground segmentation, (ii). feature vector extraction, and (iii). wheelchair detection. The GMMs technique was used to extract a moving object from a background, while the underlying feature vectors of the moving objects were obtained using the HOG method. Finally, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) was implemented to classify a wheelchair object. We implemented 1,217 images for evaluating the performance of our proposed method which results in 86.01% of the accuracy rate. The advantage of our proposed approach is that it can detect a wheelchair effectively without any knowledge or prior information of the previous frames.},

abstract={Ideas of building smart homes have been around for many years. However, most of them have been confined to laboratories or specially built, expensive homes due to the high cost of sensory hardware and software. In order to make some of those ideas realized for average-income households, we could resort to lower cost devices and focus more on smaller space like a bedroom or living room. Kinect sensors are able to capture motions of a human and present them as a series of time-dependent skeletons. They have been utilized in many fields such as entertainment, security, and health care. Particularly, they could be applied to assist the elderly population of which the number has been increasing substantially around the world when compared to other age groups. This work proposes the simple yet effective system that would facilitate the daily activities of an elderly person in a bedroom, e.g., helping the elderly turn on or turn off electric devices such as a television, electric fan, or room light without touching them or their remote controls. The system could also detect and alert the elderly of falling out of bed and monitor signs of abnormity or any need of assistance so that family members or caregiver could be timely notified.},

abstract={Advancements in sensor technology has provided new ways for researchers to monitor the elderly in uncontrolled environments. Sensors have become smaller, cheaper and can now be worn on the body. Smart phones are also more common in the average household and can provide some analysis of behaviour. Because of this, researchers are able to monitor behaviours in a more natural setting, which can produce useful data. For those suffering with a mental illness, this is important as it allows for continuous, non-invasive monitoring in order to diagnose symptoms from different behaviours. However, issues with the sensors and the involvement of human factors are challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges must be taken into consideration in addition to the behavioural symptoms of Dementia that can appear in the elderly. The application of sensor technologies can aid in improving the quality of life of an elderly person with Dementia and monitor the progression of the disease through behavioural analysis. This paper will provide an experiment protocol that can be used to monitor those with mild cognitive impairment in a natural environment. We will also provide data and results from an initial experiment and discuss our plans for future experimentation.},

abstract={In a context of a rapidly growing population of elderly people, this paper introduces a novel method for behavioural anomaly detection relying on a self-organized learning process. This method first models the Circadian Activity Rhythm of a set of sensors and compares it to a nominal profile to determine variations in patients' activities. The anomalies are detected by a multi-agent system as a linear relation of those variations, weighted by influence parameters. The problem of adaptation to a particular patient then becomes the problem of learning the adequate influence parameters. Those influence parameters are self-adjusted, using feedback provided at any time by the medical staff. This approach is evaluated on a synthetic environment and results show both the capacity to effectively learn influence parameters and the resilience of this system to parameter size. Details on the ongoing real-world experimentation are provided.},

abstract={This paper presents an application-agnostic Quality of service (QoS) framework forWireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). The applications of WBAN includes several areas such as smart health care, assisted elderly living and emergency response. In the WBAN, obtaining an acceptable QoS performance is extremely important due to its relation with human health and emergency situation. The QoS requirements of a sensor in WBAN is tightly related to the context of its application. Therefore, successful design of a QoS frameworks needs to be application context-aware. In this paper, we propose a contexta-ware framework to guarantee the QoS requirements of the sensor nodes in the WBAN. Our framework is implemented as a separate module which is independent of the application layer and can be utilized for different medical applications. Additionally, our framework enables the medical application to dynamically adapt to the QoS changes due to the nature of application and patient's health status.},

abstract={Automatically estimating a person's energy expenditure has numerous uses, including ensuring sufficient daily activity by an elderly live-alone person, such activity shown to have numerous benefits. Most previous work requires a person to wear a sensor device. We introduce a video-based activity level estimation technique to take advantage of increasingly-common in-home camera systems. We consider several features of a motion bounding rectangle for such estimation, including changes in height and width, and vertical and horizontal velocities and accelerations. Experiments involved 36 recordings of normal household activity, such as reading while seated, sweeping, and light exercising, involving 4 different actors. Results show, somewhat surprisingly, that the feature horizontal acceleration leads to an activity level estimation fidelity of 0.994 correlation with a commercial BodyBugg body-worn energy measurement device. Furthermore, the approach yielded 90.9% average accuracy of energy expenditure.},

abstract={The Pervasive Computing Laboratory at the University of Florida is dedicated to creating smart environments and assistants to enable elderly persons to live a longer and a more independent life at home. By achieving this goal, technology will increase the chances of successful aging despite an ailing health care system (e.g. Medicaid). One of the essential services required to maximize the intelligence of a smart environment is an indoor precision tracking system. Such system allows the smart home to make proactive decisions to better serve its occupants by enabling context-awareness instead of being solely reactive to their commands. This paper presents our hands-on experience and lessons learnt from our first phase work to build up a smart home infrastructure for the elderly. We review location tracking technology and describe the rationale behind our choice of the emerging ultrasonic sensor technology. We give an overview of the House of Matilda (an in-laboratory mock up house) and describe our design of a precision in-door tracking system. We also describe an OSGi-based robust framework that abstracts the ultrasonic technology into a standard service to enable the creation of tracking based applications by third party, and to facilitate the collaboration among various devices and other OSGi services. Finally, we describe three pervasive computing applications that use the location-tracking system which we have implemented in Matilda's house.},

abstract={The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought great changes for non-contact and non-destructive sensing and diagnosis. For every inanimate object can tell us something by the sound it makes, acoustic sensor demonstrates great advantages comparing to conventional electronic and mechanic sensors in such cases: overcoming environmental obstacles, mapping to existing use cases of detecting problems with human ears, low cost for deployment, etc. It could be widely applied to various domains, such as predictive maintenance of machinery, robot sensory, elderly and baby care in smart home, etc. Whether we can use the acoustic sensor data to understand what is happening and to predict what will happen relies heavily on the analytics capabilities we apply to the acoustic data, which has to overcome the obstacles of noise, disturbance and errors, and has to meet the requirement of real-time processing of high volume signals with large number of sensors. In this paper, we propose a scalable cognitive acoustics analytics service for IoT that provides the user an incremental learning approach to evolve their analytics capability on non-intuitive and unstructured acoustic data through the combination of acoustic signal processing and machine learning technology. It first performs acoustic signal processing and denoising, enables acoustic signal based abnormal detection based on sound intensity, spectral centroid, etc. Then based on the accumulated abnormal data, a supervised learning method is performed as baseline and a neural network based classifier is used to recognize acoustic events in different scenarios with various volume of sample data and requirement of accuracy. In addition, acoustic sensor arrays processing is supported for localization of moving acoustic source in more complex scenario. In this paper, we designed a hybrid computing structure. Finally, we conduct experiments on acoustic event recognition for machinery diagnosis, and show that the proposed system can achieve high accuracy.},

abstract={The life expectancy is rapidly growing in many countries. According to the United Nations, the percentage of elderly population will rise from 5% in 2013 to 11% in 2050. The increasing aging of the population implies an increase of age-related diseases, and an increase in terms of health-care costs. The innovations introduced by pervasive computing, and in particular by sensor-based activity monitoring methods, can be exploited to early detect the onset of health issues. For this reason, we devised a novel method to recognize anomalies that a senior performs during the execution of activities of daily living, based on data acquired from unobtrusive sensors deployed at home. The objective is to support the clinicians in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, providing them with fine-grained information about abnormal behaviors. In this paper, we present a demonstration of the method, based on a graphical tool that simulates the execution of activities and abnormal behaviors of an elderly person in a sensor-rich smart home.},

abstract={Adaptation decisions made by context-aware applications on behalf of users are based on evaluations of current context and preferences of users. This context information is imperfect by nature and can cause applications to behave in ways that users do not expect. Applications that exhibit unwanted behaviour will negatively impact their usability and violate the trust users have in them. Intelligibility and control in applications can help users to understand why they decided to behave in certain ways, and to forgive the applications by enabling users to override the undesirable adaptation. This paper presents a non-monotonic rule based approach (defeasible logic) for modelling user preferences, which serves as the basis of decision-making of application adaptations. It facilitates automatic generation of explanations regarding reasoning of defeasible preferences. The model also supports creation of feedback mechanisms for nontechnical users to formulate their own preferences independently, and modify the adaptation decision process to control application behaviours. Moreover, to demonstrate its applicability we have designed a set of evolvable situations and a context model, which complement the defeasible preferences for building smart home applications to enhance health care of the elderly.},

abstract={Smart environments have progressed and evolved into a significant research area with development of sensor technology, wireless communication and machine learning strategies. Ambient Intelligence incorporated into smart environment assists in resolving many social related applications to facilitate the future society. The initiative of modeling Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in smart homes have helped in the deployment of applications to various domains like elderly care, health care etc. Activity recognition is the task involved in reasoning within smart homes with the aim of recognizing the ongoing activity of the occupant. Constructing an activity model is essential to carry out recognition and is achieved through various machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Data driven approach constructs activity model through statistical machine learning mechanisms while knowledge driven approach constructs activity model through knowledge representation and modeling strategies. Uncertainty and temporal data are better handled by data driven approach while re-usability and context based analysis is handled better by knowledge driven approach of activity modeling. To combine the features of data driven and knowledge driven approaches, a hybrid activity modeling technique is required. The proposed system performs activity modeling via Markov Logic Network, a machine learning strategy that combines probabilistic reasoning and logical reasoning with a single framework. Activities in a smart home are categorized as simple and composite activities, wherein composite activities are defined as related simple activities within a given time interval. The proposed system models both simple and composite activity using soft and hard rules of MLN. Experiments carried over the proposed system shows the effectiveness of the proposed work for recognizing simple and composite activity.},

abstract={Home emergencies affect greatly the health of inhabitants (mostly children, elderly and dependent persons). Nowadays, the deployment of smart home doesn't require purchasing expensive devices due to advances in communication and computing technologies. However, implementing a customized home emergencies management system is not an easy task. Indeed, it involves two disciplines: (i) Medicine and (ii) Information and Communication Technologies as mentioned by the World Health Organization.In this paper, we propose an approach that hybridizes the two concepts: FSM theory and set theory. The aim is being to facilitate (i) the design of the system behavior for the health professionals, (ii) the translation of the human readable format (emergency management rules) to a machine readable format for the computer specialist, and (iii) mainly the verification of the FSM properties for reducing human errors for both of them. The paper gives the formal description of the set-based FSM, properties that have to be taken into account and the representation of process algebra expressions. Finally, we describe a case study to illustrate the benefits of the proposed FSM.},

abstract={The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) from video can prove particularly useful in assisted living and smart home environments, as behavioral and lifestyle profiles can be constructed through the recognition of ADLs over time. Often, existing methods for recognition of ADLs have a very high computational cost, which makes them unsuitable for real time or near real time applications. In this work we present a novel method for recognizing ADLs with accuracy comparable to the state of the art, at a lowered computational cost. Comprehensive testing of the best existing descriptors, encoding methods and BoW/SVM based classification methods takes place to determine the optimal recognition solution. A statistical method for determining the temporal duration of extracted trajectories is also introduced, to streamline the recognition process and make it less ad-hoc. Experiments take place with benchmark ADL datasets and a newly introduced set of ADL recordings of elderly people with dementia as well as healthy individuals. Our algorithm leads to accurate recognition rates, comparable or better than the State of the Art, at a lower computational cost.},

abstract={The dual-task paradigm is a promising procedure for estimating cognitive status and may also be collaterally used to reduce cognitive decline and prevent dementia. In this paper, we use the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) to the assess cognitive status in the elderly as a reference and investigate the potential of using machine learning for early detecting cognitive impairment in the elderly. Although many studies have suggested that dual-task performance, in which participants perform a cognitive task while walking, is associated with cognition, they only considered the correlation between cognitive parameters and simple gait feature, such as gait speed, through the statistical analysis. We instead use a Kinect sensor to capture participants' whole-body movements and extract a rich gait feature that has the ability to exhibit different tendencies of movements between healthy and cognitive-impaired elderlies. In our experiments, a classifier based on the dual-task gait feature achieved a higher performance than the one based on the single-task feature; the performance of the rich gait feature was better than that of a simple one, and; an optimal detection performance was achieved with an MMSE cutoff score of 25. We positively validated that the proposed method could early detect elderly with lower MMSE scores based on dual-task gait feature with a promising performance. Our approach can support early and automated diagnosis of cognitive impairment.},

abstract={In recent years, we have witnessed a rapid surge in assisted living technologies due to a rapidly aging society. The aging population, the increasing cost of formal health care, the caregiver burden, and the importance that the individuals place on living independently, all motivate development of innovative-assisted living technologies for safe and independent aging. In this survey, we will summarize the emergence of `ambient-assisted living” (AAL) tools for older adults based on ambient intelligence paradigm. We will summarize the state-of-the-art AAL technologies, tools, and techniques, and we will look at current and future challenges.},

abstract={Rapid increase of elderly population in the world is motivating innovative technologies for healthcare services that are both high-quality and cost-effective. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based smart home for assisted living is one of the most prosperous solutions to this area, since it removes the requirement of deploying wired devices and is easy to be implemented in existing home environments. However, limited battery capacity of sensor nodes constraints the lifetime of WSNs and prevents this solution to be widely accepted by the industry. Therefore, this paper proposes a logical correlation-based sleep scheduling mechanism (LCSSM) to achieve energy-efficient WSNs in smart homes. LCSSM first automatically generates logical correlations between sensors by learning from living patterns of different home residents. It then activates/deactivates sensors according to their logical correlations to reduce energy consumption. Numerical evaluation results based on real datasets have validated that the proposed LCSSM not only reduces energy consumption of WSNs significantly, but also retains the quality of sensing successfully. Specifically speaking, sensors with LCSSM successfully sense more than 94% valuable events occurred in the smart home with only 23%-57% active time of the whole evaluation period.},

abstract={The physical and physiological changes in elderly people make difficult to perform and control basic house works; people lose progressively autonomy and independence. Moreover, the probability of total or partial abandonment is increasingly high, limiting an adequate monitoring of the person's health, which could prevent many of the problems typical of aging by generating alerts and/r appropriate actions. In order to mitigate these problems, in this work a solution based on ambience intelligence is proposed; the idea is to provide assistance to elderly people in everyday actions. The system includes the automation of home processes, and the use of the information gathered during the daily activities of the person in order to operate a multi agent system. The central intelligent component, utilizes the registered information, to make decisions oriented to the wellbeing of the person based on the analysis of behavior patterns.},

abstract={In the framework of context awareness within the home, our team is currently assessing the unobtrusive detection of inhabitants' activity through the monitoring of their use and consumption of electricity. The objective is to develop a system for the remote monitoring of large populations of elderly people living independently at home. To be readily deployable on the field, such a system must be minimally intrusive both for the home environment and for the field professionals (paramedics and social workers) visiting the patients at home. We carried out two successive field experiments to evaluate and to improve our system designed to deliver a single index of daily activity. The first experiment involved 13 elderly persons over a nine-month period (84 240 h data recorded) and the second one 12 elderly over six months (51 840 h). We evaluated both the relevance of the index and the acceptability of the system as a whole. We discovered that electrical activity is a kind of unique “signature” of each person's activity. Moreover, this profile provides unexpected information on the health status of the subject. We confirmed that the system was unobtrusive and well accepted both by the subjects and by the professionals involved. Our unique index of activity, and its trend over time, can provide timely information to the professionals on the patient.},

abstract={Investments in tele-care infrastructure are an increasing financial burden for private households because financial support of public authorities has decreased for several reasons. On the other hand, the presence of satisfactory IT infrastructure and the availability of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) smart devices could be a possible alternative. Being quite affordable, the adaptation of such devices for the usage in tele-health and tele-care seems to solve the financial problem. However, users of tele-health systems are usually people with a low level of technical know-how and computer literacy, e.g. elderly people. Consequently, besides other requirements, the usability of the systems used in tele-care has to be high.

abstract={Because of the increased lifespan, there is an increasing demand on prevention of disease for senior wellness. For monitoring senior wellness status, biosensors such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG), blood pressure (BP), and respiration rate (RR) sensors and environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, motion, and light sensors) were used for data collection. Sensing data from bio- and environmental sensors are transferred to gateway in smart home and gateway send data into smart home server for the storage and analysis. Sensing data is analyzed using SVM for filtering, decision tree for health risk ratio, and EM algorithm for decision making. In this paper, we develop an EM-based inspection service middleware for monitoring elderly wellness status based on time and zone transition. This inspection service middleware for the prediction of abnormal health status has three steps as follows; monitoring, activity assessment, health risk assessment and decision-making. The activity assessment step used fuzzy logic, the health risk assessment step uses the decision-tree model for the classification of health status. Finally, EM-based decision-making step recommend exercise and housework for healthy status and rest or hospital checkup for tired/sick status.},

abstract={It is recognized that car driving might have a bad influence to health, due to the lack of physical exercises, compared with the public transportation modes or active travel such as walking and cycling. However, car driving might be able to prevent a decline in physical ability, especially for aged people, since drivers are required to do physical reactions including recognition, judgement, and operation in order to drive the car. This study aims to investigate and find solutions to transport problems in super aging society. We analyzed the relationship between the driving conditions and the life satisfaction or physical activity as a preliminary study to reveal the anti-aging effect of car driving. As the conclusion, it is found that with the increase of driving frequency, the drivers have higher life satisfaction, and feel fewer burdens, since higher frequency of driving has a lower degradation effect of capability to process visual information.},

pages={339-348}, 
abstract={The early detection of dementias such as Alzheimer's disease can in some cases reverse, stop, or slow cognitive decline and in general greatly reduce the burden of care. This is of increasing significance as demographic studies are warning of an aging population in North America and worldwide. Various smart homes and systems have been developed to detect cognitive decline through continuous monitoring of high risk individuals. However, the majority of these smart homes and systems use a number of predefined heuristics to detect changes in cognition, which has been demonstrated to focus on the idiosyncratic nuances of the individual subjects, and thus, does not generalize. In this paper, we address this problem by building generalized linear models of home activity of older adults monitored using unobtrusive sensing technologies. We use inhomogenous Poisson processes to model the presence of the recruited older adults within different rooms throughout the day. We employ an information theoretic approach to compare the generalized linear models learned, and we observe significant statistical differences between the cognitively intact and impaired older adults. Using a simple thresholding approach, we were able to detect mild cognitive impairment in older adults with an average area under the ROC curve of 0.716 and an average area under the precision-recall curve of 0.706 using activity models estimated over a time window of 12 weeks.},

A review of the literature reveals various approaches to discovering and recognizing human activities.

abstract={We propose in this paper a computer vision-based posture recognition method for home monitoring of the elderly. The proposed system performs human detection prior to the posture analysis; posture recognition is performed only on a human silhouette. The human detection approach has been designed to be robust to different environmental stimuli. Thus, posture is analyzed with simple and efficient features that are not designed to manage constraints related to the environment but only designed to describe human silhouettes. The posture recognition method, based on fuzzy logic, identifies four static postures and is robust to variation in the distance between the camera and the person, and to the person's morphology. With an accuracy of 74.29% of satisfactory posture recognition, this approach can detect emergency situations such as a fall within a health smart home.},

abstract={Japan has emphasized in the strategy of smart city which we believe an inevitable trend for the social innovation of Japanese cities. The current trend of smart tourism is becoming one of the important part for the urban renovation due to integration of ICT technology in tourism. However, there are plenty of regions which are facing different kinds of social problems. For example, most of the cities in Hokkaido are facing population decline, decreasing birthrate and rapid aging population. Similarly, most of the youth from rural cities migrate to bigger cities leading to burden for urban communities. In this social context, the smart tourism is an important part and a practical attempt of the smart city strategy.

abstract={Smart environments are composed of heterogeneous smart devices and interface modalities that make a smart environment complex in its structure. This complexity can be challenging for users, in particular for elderly, while interacting with a smart environment. To address this problem, we introduce a framework for a user-centered assistance in smart environments allowing users to get an overview of relevant functions of the smart environment and to obtain support for optimizing their home automation based on the users needs. This assistance achieved through the framework aims to reduce the perceived complexity of smart environments for users, so that especially elderly users can be supported by the smart environment. This paper focuses on the framework consisting on the one hand of a Digital Agent processing data and providing an adaptive user interface. On the other hand a Device-Interface is a further component of the framework providing access to context data of smart environments being a requirement for the Digital Agent to perform its tasks.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed advances of Internet of Things technologies and their applications to enable contactless sensing and elderly care in smart homes. Continuous and real-time respiration monitoring is one of the important applications to promote assistive living for elders during sleep and attracted wide attention in both academia and industry. Most of the existing respiration monitoring systems require expensive and specialized devices to sense chest displacement. However, chest displacement is not a direct indicator of breathing and thus false detection may often occur. In this paper, we design and implement a real-time and contactless respiration monitoring system by directly sensing the exhaled airflow from breathing using ultrasound signals with off-the-shelf speaker and microphone. Exhaled airflow from breathing can be regarded as air turbulence, which scatters the sound wave and results in Doppler effect. Our system works as an acoustic radar which transmits sound wave and detects the Doppler effect caused by breathing airflow. We mathematically model the relationship between the Doppler frequency change and the direction of breathing airflow. Based on this model, we design a minimum description length-based algorithm to effectively capture the Doppler effect caused by exhaled airflow. We conduct extensive experiments with 25 participants (7 elders, 2 young kids, and 16 adults, including 11 females and 14 males) in four different rooms. The participants take four different sleep postures (lying on one's back, on right/left side, and on one's stomach) in different positions of the bed. Experiment results show that our system achieves a median error lower than 0.3 breaths/min (2%) for respiration monitoring and can accurately identify Apnea. The results also demonstrate that the system is robust to different respiration styles (shallow, normal, and deep), respiration rate variation, ambient noise, sensing distance variation (within 0.7 m), and transmitted signal frequency variation.},

abstract={Considerations of how to facilitate aging-in-place are becoming increasingly pertinent as caregivers are overwhelmed by an aging population. A primary challenge to independent living is the inability to use products associated with tasks of daily living. As improving the usability of these products for the elderly will extend their independence, this work attempts to automate and expedite the assessment of usability using artificial intelligence. Video analysis is performed to temporally segment video of human-product interaction and automatically identify segments in which the human has difficulty operating the product. The approach is applied to the study of water faucet designs for older adults with dementia. Empirical analysis is performed on videos of dementia patients operating various faucet types, demonstrating the accuracy of the temporal segmentation (88.1%) and the ability to estimate the relative advantage of either design in terms of operational ease.},

abstract={Recently, IoT (Internet of Things) technologies have been attracting increasing attention. Among many applications of IoT, homes can be the most promising target. One of the purposes to deploy IoT in homes is automatic recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs). It is expected that ADL recognition in homes enables many new services such as elderly people monitoring and low energy appliance control. In existing studies on ADL recognition, however, it is hard to build a system to acquire data for ADL recognition in terms of installation cost. In this paper, we propose a method that reduces costs of the ADL recognition system by using ECHONET Lite-ready appliances which are expected to be widely spread in the future. ECHONET Lite is a communication protocol for control and sensor networks in smart-homes and standardized as ISO/IEC-4-3. The proposed method utilizes information (e.g., on/off state) from appliances and motion sensors attached to them as features and recognizes ADLs through machine learning. To evaluate the proposed method, we collected data in our smart-home testbed while several participants are living there. As a result, the proposed method achieved about 68% classification accuracy for 9 different activities.},

abstract={The global human population is aging rapidly, however, living longer does not necessarily mean living healthy, active and independent life. The emerging disruptive technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) are proving instrumental in addressing this prominent societal challenge. Urban IoT infrastructures, designed to support the Smart City vision, enable capturing of personal data for analyzing behaviour of elderly people. Activities within the Horizon 2020 City 4Age project are aimed at showing that behavioral analysis can help detect and mitigate risks of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and frailty problems of elderly. This paper presents the latest developments in extending the configurability and flexibility of the comprehensive City4Age computational model for risk detection. The proposed model extensions have demonstrated seamless adaptation to specific characteristics of various urban contexts, as well as seamless “pluggable” integration of various combined evolving and extendable parameterized algorithm implementations and methods for behaviour variation and risk recognition, based on relevant statistical and machine learning techniques.},

However, the existing methods have various problems: invasion of privacy, limited target activities, low recognition accuracy, initial installation cost, and long recognition time. As our prior work, we proposed a real-time ADL recognition method using indoor positioning sensor and power meters. We got a result that the method can recognize ten types of ADL with the average accuracy of 79%. However, the accuracy of some activities such as work/study and bathroom-related were not satisfactory. In this work, we aim to improve the accuracy of our prior method by newly adding several new time and are related features such as time slot when activity occurs, staying time in the same area, and previous position. As a result, we could achieve 82% of average recognition accuracy for 10 different activities.},

abstract={To promote independent living and elderly care in a smart living space, monitoring the activities of daily living and detecting upcoming critical situations are crucial. Thus, exploiting the spatial aspect related to the movement of the resident and their relations to a specific region is important. However, most of existing solutions do not consider related spatial aspect or it is incorporated in a very limited way, in which most solutions need to know the deployment location of sensors. To achieve this, a very time consuming sensor labeling process is needed. In this paper, an unsupervised spatial information extraction technique for smart living space is developed. This technique establishes an abstract spatial representation called virtual location for a physical living space without knowing the actual deployment location of the sensors in that space. A virtual location is achieved by utilizing our extended Louvain modularity method to extract key spatial features from the hidden correlations in the observations perceived through the sensors. By considering the characteristics of different sensors, the effectiveness of virtual location can be further improved. Two real world datasets are used to validate the applicability of the propose technique, and the experimental results for them achieve 90.3% and 71.7% V-measure values respectively.},

abstract={This paper presents a step toward the development of a data-centric approach to prevention of Mild Cognitive Impairment and frailty in the elderly population. The scientific literature provides a large number of “indicators” for assessing the quality of behavior for aged individuals, in order to predict possible decaying. On the opposite side, a large variety of sensors and datasets today allows the effective collection of elementary data about actions performed by individuals. This paper proposes to build a bridge between these two sides. In a bottom-up vision, data from sensors and smart cities' datasets are aggregated and interpreted in a way that leads to reliable assessment of the indicators. In a top-down vision, indicators are translated into data analysis. The work described in this paper is part of City4age, a project partially funded by the EU within the H2020 Programme.},

The system performs a range of services including data collection and analysis of long term trends in behaviors and physiological parameters (e.g. relating to sleep or daily activity); warnings, alarms and reminders; and social interaction through the telepresence robot. The latter is based on the Giraff telepresence robot, which is already in place in a number of homes.

Therefore various kinds of supporting systems have been developed to help the elders, who have mild memory problems. In this paper we propose a Smart Reminder System for reminding forgotten complex activities, in home environment. Subjected complex activities are the activities, which should be completed as originally intended, after they are initiated. Due to strong relationship among initiation and conclusion activities, those activities are called as “Coupling Activities” in this paper. Reminders for forgotten Coupling Activities are predicted according to the user's current behaviour, current location and past activity patterns. Therefore wearable sensors are used to gather required data for identifying user's context. A reason for forgetting also is predicted with the reminder. Reminders are predicted with minimum supervision of the user, as the system learns the user's dynamic behaviour by itself. Proposed Smart Reminder System could achieve 80% average accuracy rate for reminder prediction in a system evaluation, which was done using four subjects.},

abstract={As smart homes are being more and more popular, the needs of finding assisting systems which interface between users and home environments are growing. Furthermore, for elderly and disabled people living in such homes it is totally important to develop devices, which can support and aid them in their ordinary daily life. This demands means and tools that extend independent living and promote improved health. In this work we reviewed the state of the art in the assistant systems in home environments. A case study of medical assisting system for elderly and people with disabilities is discussed deeply. A smart nfc-based person-specific assistant system for services in home environment is proposed. The role of this system is the assisting by controlling of home activities and adaption of home-human interface towards the needs of the considered person. For the special case of medical assisting the system has the ability of providing for elderly or disabled people person-specific medical assistance. The system has the ability of identifying its interaction partner using some biometric features. According to the recognized ID the system, first, adopts towards the needs of recognized person. Second the system represents person-specific list of medicaments either visually, on screen, or acoustic, speaker. And third the system gives an alarm in the case of taking medicament either later or earlier as normal taking time.},

abstract={As the elderly people living alone are enormously increasing recently, we need the system inferring activities of daily living (ADL) for maintaining healthy life and recognizing emergency. The system should be constructed with sensors, which are used to associate with people's living while remaining as non intrusive views as possible. To do this, the proposed system use a triaxial accelerometer sensor and environment sensors indicating contact with subject in home. Particularly, in order to robustly infer ADLs, we present component ADL, which is decided with conjunction of human motion together, not just only contacted object identification. It is an important component in inferring ADL. In special, component ADL decision firstly refines misclassified initial activities, which improves the accuracy of recognizing ADL. Preliminary experiments results for proposed system provides overall recognition rate of over 97% over 8 component ADLs, which can be effectively applicable to recognize the final ADLs.},

abstract={In this paper, we implement human activity tracking and recognition system utilizing body joints features using depth maps. During HAR settings, depth maps are processed to track human silhouettes by considering temporal continuity constraints of human motion information and compute centroids for each activity based on contour generation. In body joints features, depth silhouettes are computed first through geodesic distance to identify anatomical landmarks which produce joint points information from specific body parts. Then, body joints are processed to produce centroid distance features and key joints distance features. Finally, Self-Organized Map (SOM) is employed to train and recognize different human activities from the features. Experimental results show that body joints features achieved high recognition rate over the conventional features. The proposed system should be applicable as e-healthcare systems for monitoring elderly people, surveillance systems for observing pedestrian traffic areas and indoor environment systems which recognize activities of multiple users.},

abstract={Recent studies have demonstrated that geographic location features collected using smartphones can be a powerful predictor for depression. While location information can be conveniently gathered by GPS, typical datasets suffer from significant periods of missing data due to various factors (e.g., phone power dynamics, limitations of GPS). A common approach is to remove the time periods with significant missing data before data analysis. In this paper, we develop an approach that fuses location data collected from two sources: GPS and WiFi association records. Our evaluation demonstrates that our data fusion approach leads to significantly more complete data, which improves feature extraction and depression screening.},

Smart homes especially tailored to meet elderly and disabled people's needs can help them maintaining their autonomy, whilst ensuring their safety and well-being. This paper proposes a complete context-aware system for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which infers user's actions and context, analyzing its past and current behavior to detect anomalies and prevent possible emergencies. The proposed system exploits Dynamic Bayesian Networks to merge raw data coming from heterogeneous sensors and infer user's behavior and health conditions. A rule-based reasoner is able to detect and predict anomalies in such data, sending appropriate alerts to caregivers and family members. The effectiveness of the proposed AAL system is demonstrated by extensive experimental results carried out in a simulated smart home.},

abstract={Falling down is a great threat to the health of the elderly. Existing approaches for fall detection, such as threshold methods and offline classification methods, have been shown to be useful for providing emergency medical care for the elderly. However, those offline models lack generalization and adaptability for all the users in everyday life, which severely restricts their applications in real life situations. In this paper, we propose a cloud computing based fall detection framework which can update the model online with two-stage incremental update step. By applying cloud computing, the framework can take advantage of wearable sensors for more accurate and efficient fall detection. The proposed framework is comprised of a two-stage incremental update, which consists of local and cloud components. The local component updates the detection model with feedback from users, which can make the model more personalized for users in a timely manner. In the cloud component, the model can achieve self-improvement based on the data of daily livings collected from other users. Our simulation experiments show that our framework can achieve higher precision and recall with the incremental update based on data from all users.},

abstract={Gait velocity has been considered the sixth vital sign. It can not only be used to estimate the survival rate of the elderly but also to predict the tendency of falling. Unfortunately, gait velocity is required to be measured using specially designed walk path with minimal walk distance, which has to be conducted at clinics or health institutes. Wearable tracking services using accelerometer or inertial measurement unit can measure the velocity for certain time interval but not all the time due to lack of sustainable energy source. To tackle the shortcoming of wearable sensors, this work develops the framework to measure gait velocity using distributed tracking services deployed indoor. Given the numerous errors caused by remote sensing, the framework takes into account the temporal and spatial relationship among tracking services to calibrate the tracking services systematically. Consequently, the gait velocity can be measured without wearable sensors and at higher accuracy.},

volume={},

abstract={This paper presents the fields results in non-obtrusive life sign monitoring performed using a low emission, compact high frequency Doppler radar, which can detect body movements associated with breathing and the heart beating. Such a system is particularly useful where attaching sensors to the body is undesirable; for example, monitoring detainees in a prison who are at risk of suicide, self-harm, and medical complications due to drugs or alcohol. This method of monitoring can aid greatly in situations where it can be difficult to ascertain a person's status, such as a person who is sleeping under a blanket. While a breathing and cardiac signal is visible in the Doppler radar signal, it can be corrupted by noise and interference by so-called nuisance signals (e.g., movements associated with fans, water flowing from faucets and toilets, door micro-motion, light fixture ballast vibration and other body movements). This work is part of a three-year project that involves four organizations; CSC (end-user), KG Spectrum (radar-based perimeter intrusion detection systems), Carleton-University (bio-medical) and Ottawa-University (signal processing). The final goal is to develop a robust system for detection of attempted suicide events in prisons in time to allow for lifesaving interventions. This has been done in a novel way by installing one high range (75cm) spacial resolution, scanning antenna and high frequency (24.125GHz) radars in prison cells and by processing signals extracted from the radars in real-time. This unique radar architecture allows the usage of novel signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms to locate the subject and removing interference and reliably estimate breathing and heartbeat signals, even when the subject is non-stationary and then to produce an alarm when these signals cannot be observed or significant changes, in breathing pattern or heart rate pattern, representing abnormal behavior have been detected within the observation cell. This research project is performing time, frequency and pattern domain analysis on the radar data and explores signal processing approaches for the robust and accurate detection and estimation of the respiratory with heartbeat rate. Outcome of this research will be useful in mitigating the risks associated with detainees by providing a life sign monitoring approach that can help enable timely responses. Such a system can also find application in smart health homes for monitoring people at risk, such as the elderly or infants, as well as in psychological institution. In addition to presenting the results of filed trial, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using high frequency, high range resolution and high sampling rate as a mean to geo-localize the source of movement within the prison cells, thereby increasing the efficiency of the signal processing eliminating the need to process on overall volume wise integrated Doppler signal. The use of geo-localization provides natural discrimination of source of nuisance, allowing the signal processor focusing on Doppler signal solely produced by the inmate heart beat and breathing responses.},

Many research groups are studying pervasive solutions to continuously and unobtrusively monitor fragile subjects at their homes, reducing health-care costs and supporting medical diagnosis. Among the several behavioral aspects which clinicians are interested in monitoring, anomalous behaviors while performing activities of daily living are of great importance. In this work, we aim at improving the state of the art on this topic by enabling the recognition of fine-grained anomalies by detecting specific object manipulations. We attach tiny Bluetooth Low Energy accelerometers to several household objects in order to detect which manipulations are performed by the inhabitant on which object. Detected manipulations, combined with data from other environmental sensors deployed in the home, are used to infer ADLs and fine-grained abnormal behaviors. Preliminary results on a dataset with hundreds of complex activities captured in a smarthome environment show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Automatic recognition of activities of daily living (ADL) can be applied to realize services to support user life such as elderly monitoring, energy-saving home appliance control, and health support. In particular, “real-time” ADL recognition is essential to realize such a service that the system needs to know the user's current activity. There are many studies on ADL recognition. However, none of these studies address all of the following problems: (1) privacy intrusion due to the utilization of high privacy-invasive devices such as cameras and microphones; (2) limited number of recognizable activities; (3) low recognition accuracy; (4) high deployment and maintenance costs due to many sensors used; and (5) long recognition time. In our prior work, we proposed a system which solves the problems (1)- (4) to some extent by using user's position data and power consumption data of home electric appliances. In this paper, aiming to solve all the above problems including (5), we propose a new system by extending our prior work. To realize “real-time” ADL recognition while keeping good recognition accuracy, we developed new power meters with higher sensing frequency and introduced new techniques such as adding new features, selecting the best subset of the features, and selecting the best training dataset used for machine learning. We collected the sensor data in our smart home facility for 11 days, and applied the proposed method to these sensor data. As a result, the proposed method achieved accuracy of 79.393% in recognizing 10 types of ADLs.},

abstract={Human-computer interaction has been a more popular research field in recent years with the escalating interest in wearable systems. In this context, evaluating the details of the physical movement of the human body has become a prominent subject for researchers. The systems, which are yielded from this subject, are utilized in such areas as health, public safety, access control and smart home systems. That kind of system is expected to give fast and reliable results and can be used comfortably for the user. In this study, a fast and accurate system design about recognition of daily human activities including falls in the elderly is proposed. In addition, another main objective of the study is to examine whether an accelerometer can be set in different positions during a person’s daily activities. Motion data have been acquired from the waist, wrist and knee positions of 5 female and 15 male volunteers using a 3-axis accelerometer. In this way; walking, sitting, standing up, jumping and falling motions were collected from volunteers. PCA method was used as a feature reduction method to reduce the process time and get quick results. Furthermore, any feature extraction method was not used. The SVM, MLP, RBF and Naive Bayes classifiers were employed to perform classification success. The proposed technique achieved a maximum of 100%, an average of 96,54% accuracy on the defined 3 positions. As a result, it has been determined that a single accelerometer can be set in different positions. The findings also suggest this method can be used in home care and follow-up procedures and fall detection for elderly people.},

The algorithm development combined computer vision techniques with design science. The silhouette-based video produced was sufficient for a coach to provide analysis of static and dynamic critical features of golf swings (e.g. stance, tempo and swing plane). In looking beyond eSport systems, the achieved outcomes (robustness to colours, contrast, diverse video resolutions and lightning intensity changes) and insights are universally applicable to enable human-or AI-based motion activity analytics.

abstract={The papers in this special section focus on advancements in healthcare technologies and services. THE demand and market of healthcare services are increasing exponentially. This is due to the problem of aging and the reformation of healthcare services. The aging problem is a serious global issue that after 30 years, the portion of the elderly who are aged at least 60 years old will be 20% of the world’s population. The human immune system becomes weaker with aging and the elderly are more likely to suffer various injuries and diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory infection. Medical services such as hospitals and clinics are facing critical challenges to the quality of services and the capability of handling patients. To reform modern healthcare services, one solution is to realize smart healthcare in the concept of the smart city. There are four key components in futuristic smart healthcare, which are smart sensors, healthcare network, anomaly detection algorithm, and robot-assisted medical services.},

abstract={The papers in this special section focus on cyber-physical man-machine systems with particular emphasis on situation, activity, and goal awareness deployed in these systems. Recent advances in sensing technologies, the Internet of Things, pervasive computing, smart environments have transformed traditional embedded ICT systems into an ecosystem of interconnected and collaborating smart objects, devices, embedded systems, and most importantly humans. Such systems, often referred to as cyber-physical systems (CPS), are usually human user-driven or user-centered, and are aimed at providing people and businesses with a wide range of innovative applications and services. For example, a “smart home” can monitor and analyze the daily activities of its inhabitants, usually the elderly or individuals with disabilities, so that personalized context-aware assistance can be provided. A “smart city” can monitor, manage, and potentially control all basic city functionalities such as transport, energy supply, and waste collection, at a higher level of automation by collecting and harnessing sensor data across a large geographic expanse. In order to respond in real-time to an individual user’s speciﬁc needs in dynamic and complex situations, and to support ergonomics and user-friendliness through consideration of human factors such as privacy, dignity, and behavior characteristics, cyber-physical human–machine systems need to be aware of the physical environment and human participant behavior. This awareness enables effective and fast feedback loops between sensing and actuation, possibly with cognitive and learning capabilities adapting to participant preferences, capabilities, and the modality of human–machine interaction as well as dynamic situations. },

abstract={Summary form only given. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the U.S. population of people aged 65 and up will grow more than double in between 2010 and 2050. The market for remote patient monitoring is expected to grow from $10.6 billion in 2012 to $21.2 billion in 2017. This growing societal and economical needs revitalize the work on technology-assisted proactive and preventive health monitoring in smart home environments. In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults. I will also discuss the comparative performance of technology-guided algorithmic methodology with clinically-driven survey, observation, and performance-based measurements. I will conclude the talk highlighting our experiences of deploying this smart home health service systems for Alzheimer's patients living in retirement community centers.},
